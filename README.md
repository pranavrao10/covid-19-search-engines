### Why Is There an Empty Folder on Here (insert *monkey head scratch*)
Sup Chefs :) (we can change the read me later so this is temporary). You will notice that the repo currently contains an empty folder called `dirichlet_lm_index_variables`. This is intentional,
as I think it makes the codebase more organised to have the necessary generated files to build the language model index in a separate folder instead of dumping everything in the same directory as our retrieval function implementations! 

### Instructions on How to Run Dirichlet LM Search Engine
1) Please first run `dirichlet_lm_index_builder.py` to generate the necessary files to build the index. NOTE: this only needs to be run once!!
2) Once that's done, just run `dirichlet_search.py` and everything should work.
3) Go crazy!! The search engine will not terminate until you hit keyboard interupt.

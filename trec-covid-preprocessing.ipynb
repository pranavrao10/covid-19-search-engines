'biobert': {'title': 'clinical features of culture-proven mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at king abdulaziz university hospital jeddah saudi arabia', 'abstract': 'objective this retrospective chart review describes the epidemiology and clinical features of 40 patients with culture-proven mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at king abdulaziz university hospital jeddah saudi arabia. methods patients with positive m. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from january 1997 through december 1998 were identified through the microbiology records. charts of patients were reviewed. results 40 patients were identified 33 82.5 of whom required admission. most infections 92.5 were community-acquired. the infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants 32.5 and pre-school children 22.5 . it occurred year-round but was most common in the fall 35 and spring 30 . more than three-quarters of patients 77.5 had comorbidities. twenty-four isolates 60 were associated with pneumonia 14 35 with upper respiratory tract infections and 2 5 with bronchiolitis. cough 82.5 fever 75 and malaise 58.8 were the most common symptoms and crepitations 60 and wheezes 40 were the most common signs. most patients with pneumonia had crepitations 79.2 but only 25 had bronchial breathing. immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia 8 9 versus 16 31 p 0.05 . of the 24 patients with pneumonia 14 58.3 had uneventful recovery 4 16.7 recovered following some complications 3 12.5 died because of m pneumoniae infection and 3 12.5 died due to underlying comorbidities. the 3 patients who died of m pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities. conclusion our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high.', 'body': \"mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. it remains one of the most frequent causes of atypical pneumonia particularly among young adults. 1 2 3 4 5 although it is highly transmissible most infections caused by this organism are relatively minor and include pharyngitis tracheobronchitis bronchiolitis and croup with one fifth of infections being asymptomatic. 6 7 only 3 -10 of infected subjects develop symptoms consistent with bronchopneumonia and mortality from infection is rare. 6 7 the organism is fastidious and difficult to grow on cultures. therefore diagnosis of infections caused by this organism is usually confirmed with serological tests or polymerase chain reaction-gene amplification techniques. at king abdulaziz university hospital kauh jeddah saudi arabia the facility to perform mycoplasma culture has been available since january 1997. as published information concerning m. pneumoniae infections in saudi arabia is scarce 8 9 10 we wished to study the epidemiology and clinical features of culture-proven infections caused by this organism at this hospital. kauh is a tertiary care teaching hospital with a bed capacity of 265 beds and annual admissions of 18000 to 19000 patients. patients with m. pneumoniae positive cultures from respiratory specimens were identified over a 24-months period from january 1997 through december 1998 for this review. during the study period respiratory specimens sputum nasopharyngeal aspiration endotracheal secretion and bronchoalveolar lavage for m. pneumoniae culture were obtained from patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections seen as inpatients or in the outpatient or emergency departments. respiratory specimens were aslo gram-stained and cultured for bacteria and viruses. m. pneumoniae serological tests for igg or igm were not available at kauh during the study period. all positive culture results were obtained from the microbiology laboratory records. charts of patients were reviewed with standardized data collection. information collected included patients' demographics comorbidities clinical manifestations complications and outcome. m. pneumoniae was cultured using the classic m. pneumoniae agar medium m.p. agar and the pneumofast tray pneumofast international microbio signes france . specimens were processed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. the m.p. agars and pneumofast trays were incubated anaerobically at 37 c and inspected daily for 4 weeks. the organism was identified based on typical colonial morphology granular colonies rarely fried-egg-like 10-150 in diameter on the m.p. agar medium and the change in the pneumofast broth color from red to orange then to yellow glucose fermentation in the absence of turbidity of the broth. antibiotic sensitivity profile on the pneumofast tray was also used for identification according to the instructions of the manufacturer. bacterial and viral cultures were performed using standard methods. m. pneumoniae isolates were considered community-acquired if they were recovered from unhospitalized patients or within 72 hours of admission to the hospital and nosocomial if they were recovered beyond that period. pneumonia was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and signs along with radiographic evidence of pneumonia when possible. severe pneumonia was defined as pneumonia associated with tachycardia 140 minute tachypnoea 30 minute hypotension systolic blood pressure 90 mmhg hypoxemia arterial oxygen partial pressure 8 kpa or oxygen saturation 90 and or more than 2 areas of consolidation. outcome of patients with m. pneumoniae infection was classified into 4 categories uneventful recovery recovery following complications death due to m. pneumoniae infection or death unrelated to m. pneumoniae infection. the statistical package for social sciences spss program was used for data analysis. comparison of categorical data was by chi-square statistic or fisher's exact test for small expected values. a total of 40 respiratory specimens from 40 patients were positive for m. pneumoniae over the 24-months study period. the demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the patients are summarized in table 1. of all isolates 37 92.5 were community-acquired and 3 7.5 were nosocomial. thirty-three 82.5 patients required admission to the hospital and the remaining 7 17.5 were treated as outpatients. twenty-four isolates 60 were associated with pneumonia 14 35 with upper respiratory tract infections and 2 5 with bronchiolitis. of the 24 cases of pneumonia 21 were confirmed radiologically and the remaining 3 were diagnosed clinically. the two cases of bronchiolitis occurred in 2 children one and three years old. thirty-one patients 77.5 had comorbidities. eleven patients 27.5 had cardiopulmonary comorbidities asthma 8 lung fibrosis 1 congestive heart failure 1 congenial heart disease 1 9 patients 22.5 were immunocompromised malignancy 7 steroid therapy 3 human immunodeficiency virus infection 1 and 11 patients 27.5 had other comorbidities premature newborns 2 and one each of myelodysplastic syndrome myeloproliferative disorder sickle cell anemia evan's syndrome down syndrome sarcoidosis demyelinating disease cerebral palsy and spinal muscle atrophy . organisms concomitantly isolated with m. pneumoniae from the respiratory tract included herpes simplex virus type 1 2 occasions adenovirus 2 occasions cytomegalo virus 1 occasion respiratory syncytial virus 1 occasion and bacterial isolates 2 occasions acinetobacter species 1 and enter obacter cloacae 1 . clinical manifestations associated with m. pneumoniae infections are summarized in table 2. pneumonia was more common than upper respiratory tract infections 57.5 versus 27.5 respectively . immunocompromised patients were more likely to present with pneumonia as opposed to upper respiratory tract infection or bronchiolitis than non-immunocompromised patients 8 9 versus 16 31 p 0.05 . similarly there was a tendency for patients 60 years of age or older to present with pneumonia more frequently than those below 60 4 4 versus 20 36 p 0.1 . of the 24 patients with clinically or radiologically confirmed pneumonia 19 79.2 had crepitations and only 6 25 had bronchial breath sounds on physical examination. of the 16 patients in whom wheezes were detected 9 56.3 were not known to have asthma or other obstructive airway disease. complications and outcome of patients are shown in table 3. of the 24 patients with pneumonia 21 87.5 were admitted to the hospital and 20 83.3 had comorbidities. all patients with upper respiratory tract infections 11 patients or bronchiolitis 2 patients had uneventful recovery. of the 24 patients with pneumonia 14 58.3 had uneventful recovery 4 16.7 recovered following some complications acute respiratory distress syndrome 2 respiratory failure 1 septic shock 1 3 12.5 died because of m pneumoniae infection and 3 12.5 died due to underlying comorbidities. the 3 patients who died of m pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities one had congestive heart failure the second had congenital heart disease and the third was a 3-months old infant born prematurely at 32 weeks of gestation who previously had 3 episodes of pneumonia due to other pathogens. mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of atypical pneumonia accounting for 5-23 of community-acquired pneumonia 1 2 3 4 5 in a study of 511 children with acute respiratory tract infection in riyadh saudi arabia mycoplasma pneumoniae was found to be the second most common causative agent after respiratory syncytial virus rsv accounting for 9 of all cases 8 in a study of 112 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia admitted to a military hospital in riyadh saudi arabia this organism accounted for 6 of all cases 9 in another retrospective study of 567 pneumonic episodes in adult patients from al-qassim area the organism accounted for 23 of all episodes 10 the organism also causes other relatively minor infections such as pharyngitis tracheobronchitis bronchiolitis and croup. it is transmitted from person-to-person by infected respiratory droplets during close contact. it is most common in school-aged children military recruits and college students. 11 most cases occur singly or as family outbreaks. larger outbreaks can also occur in closed populations such as military recruit camps or boarding schools 12 infection occurs most frequently during the fall and winter in temperate climates but may develop year-round 13 the average incubation period is 3 weeks following exposure 6 although rare complications are protean and may involve virtually any organ system such as the respiratory system e.g. pleurisy pneumothorax acute respiratory distress syndrome lung abscess the hematologic system e.g. hemolytic anemia intravascular coagulation thrombocytopenia the dermatologic system e.g. maculopapular or urticarial rashes erythema multiforme erythema nodosum the musculoskeletal system e.g. myalgias arthralgias arthritis the cardiovascular system e.g. pericarditis myocarditis the nervous system e.g. meningoencephalitis guillain-barre syndrome neuropathies acute psychosis or the eye optic disc edema optic nerve atrophy retinal exudation and hemorrhages . 6 7 14 15 16 17 18 immunity following infection is not long lasting. 11 in our study the infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants 32.5 and preschool children 22.5 and least common in adults aged 15 to 30 years 2.5 and elderly above 70 years of age 5 . this contrasts with data from temperate countries where the infection is most common in school-aged children and young adults. 11 one possible explanation for this difference is that infants and preschool children perhaps had more severe infections than did school-aged children and young adults which prompted presentation of the former group to the hospital. the infection occurred year-round but was most common in the fall 35 and spring 30 and least common in the summer 10 . most infections were community-acquired 92.5 . more than one half of patients 57.5 presented with pneumonia and about a third 27.5 presented with upper respiratory tract infection immunocompromised patients and patients 60 years of age or older were more likely to present with pneumonia as opposed to upper respiratory tract infection than non-immunocompromised patients or those below 60 years of age. cough 82.5 fever 75 and malaise 58.8 were the most common presenting symptoms. cough was usually dry or slightly productive of white sputum and mild to moderate in severity. most febrile patients had mild to moderate fever of 39 c or less high-grade fever of more than 39 c was rare. crepitations 60 and wheezes 40 were the most common signs. wheezes were as common in patients with no history of obstructive airway disease 9 patients as it was in those with such a history 7 patients . bronchial breathing as a sign of consolidation was detected in only one fourth of patients with pneumonia which is consistent with the known disparity between clinical and radiological signs of m pneumoniae pneumonia. crepitations however were detected in the majority 79.2 of patients. pleuritic chest pain and pleural effusion were rare. more than half 56.5 of the patients with pneumonia had uneventful recovery. mortality from m. pneumoniae pneumonia was high 12.5 and occurred only in patients with underlying comorbidities. none of the 9 patients with no underlying comorbidities died of m pneumoniae pneumonia. the relatively high complications rate 16.7 and mortality 12.5 related to m. pneumoniae pneumonia are likely due to selection bias as most patients with pneumonia were sick enough to require admission to the hospital 21 24 or 87.5 and most of them had comorbidities 20 24 or 83.3 . in conclusion our data shed some light on the epidemiology and clinical features of m pneumoniae infections in one of the saudi tertiary care centers. the data are comparable to those of other countries except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children than in school children and young adults. additionally mortality attributable to m. pneumoniae pneumonia was relatively high in patients with comorbidities. it is hoped this information will assist clinicians in their approach and management of respiratory tract infections. the pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here \", 'combined': \"clinical features of culture-proven mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at king abdulaziz university hospital jeddah saudi arabia objective this retrospective chart review describes the epidemiology and clinical features of 40 patients with culture-proven mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at king abdulaziz university hospital jeddah saudi arabia. methods patients with positive m. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from january 1997 through december 1998 were identified through the microbiology records. charts of patients were reviewed. results 40 patients were identified 33 82.5 of whom required admission. most infections 92.5 were community-acquired. the infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants 32.5 and pre-school children 22.5 . it occurred year-round but was most common in the fall 35 and spring 30 . more than three-quarters of patients 77.5 had comorbidities. twenty-four isolates 60 were associated with pneumonia 14 35 with upper respiratory tract infections and 2 5 with bronchiolitis. cough 82.5 fever 75 and malaise 58.8 were the most common symptoms and crepitations 60 and wheezes 40 were the most common signs. most patients with pneumonia had crepitations 79.2 but only 25 had bronchial breathing. immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia 8 9 versus 16 31 p 0.05 . of the 24 patients with pneumonia 14 58.3 had uneventful recovery 4 16.7 recovered following some complications 3 12.5 died because of m pneumoniae infection and 3 12.5 died due to underlying comorbidities. the 3 patients who died of m pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities. conclusion our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high. mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. it remains one of the most frequent causes of atypical pneumonia particularly among young adults. 1 2 3 4 5 although it is highly transmissible most infections caused by this organism are relatively minor and include pharyngitis tracheobronchitis bronchiolitis and croup with one fifth of infections being asymptomatic. 6 7 only 3 -10 of infected subjects develop symptoms consistent with bronchopneumonia and mortality from infection is rare. 6 7 the organism is fastidious and difficult to grow on cultures. therefore diagnosis of infections caused by this organism is usually confirmed with serological tests or polymerase chain reaction-gene amplification techniques. at king abdulaziz university hospital kauh jeddah saudi arabia the facility to perform mycoplasma culture has been available since january 1997. as published information concerning m. pneumoniae infections in saudi arabia is scarce 8 9 10 we wished to study the epidemiology and clinical features of culture-proven infections caused by this organism at this hospital. kauh is a tertiary care teaching hospital with a bed capacity of 265 beds and annual admissions of 18000 to 19000 patients. patients with m. pneumoniae positive cultures from respiratory specimens were identified over a 24-months period from january 1997 through december 1998 for this review. during the study period respiratory specimens sputum nasopharyngeal aspiration endotracheal secretion and bronchoalveolar lavage for m. pneumoniae culture were obtained from patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections seen as inpatients or in the outpatient or emergency departments. respiratory specimens were aslo gram-stained and cultured for bacteria and viruses. m. pneumoniae serological tests for igg or igm were not available at kauh during the study period. all positive culture results were obtained from the microbiology laboratory records. charts of patients were reviewed with standardized data collection. information collected included patients' demographics comorbidities clinical manifestations complications and outcome. m. pneumoniae was cultured using the classic m. pneumoniae agar medium m.p. agar and the pneumofast tray pneumofast international microbio signes france . specimens were processed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. the m.p. agars and pneumofast trays were incubated anaerobically at 37 c and inspected daily for 4 weeks. the organism was identified based on typical colonial morphology granular colonies rarely fried-egg-like 10-150 in diameter on the m.p. agar medium and the change in the pneumofast broth color from red to orange then to yellow glucose fermentation in the absence of turbidity of the broth. antibiotic sensitivity profile on the pneumofast tray was also used for identification according to the instructions of the manufacturer. bacterial and viral cultures were performed using standard methods. m. pneumoniae isolates were considered community-acquired if they were recovered from unhospitalized patients or within 72 hours of admission to the hospital and nosocomial if they were recovered beyond that period. pneumonia was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and signs along with radiographic evidence of pneumonia when possible. severe pneumonia was defined as pneumonia associated with tachycardia 140 minute tachypnoea 30 minute hypotension systolic blood pressure 90 mmhg hypoxemia arterial oxygen partial pressure 8 kpa or oxygen saturation 90 and or more than 2 areas of consolidation. outcome of patients with m. pneumoniae infection was classified into 4 categories uneventful recovery recovery following complications death due to m. pneumoniae infection or death unrelated to m. pneumoniae infection. the statistical package for social sciences spss program was used for data analysis. comparison of categorical data was by chi-square statistic or fisher's exact test for small expected values. a total of 40 respiratory specimens from 40 patients were positive for m. pneumoniae over the 24-months study period. the demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the patients are summarized in table 1. of all isolates 37 92.5 were community-acquired and 3 7.5 were nosocomial. thirty-three 82.5 patients required admission to the hospital and the remaining 7 17.5 were treated as outpatients. twenty-four isolates 60 were associated with pneumonia 14 35 with upper respiratory tract infections and 2 5 with bronchiolitis. of the 24 cases of pneumonia 21 were confirmed radiologically and the remaining 3 were diagnosed clinically. the two cases of bronchiolitis occurred in 2 children one and three years old. thirty-one patients 77.5 had comorbidities. eleven patients 27.5 had cardiopulmonary comorbidities asthma 8 lung fibrosis 1 congestive heart failure 1 congenial heart disease 1 9 patients 22.5 were immunocompromised malignancy 7 steroid therapy 3 human immunodeficiency virus infection 1 and 11 patients 27.5 had other comorbidities premature newborns 2 and one each of myelodysplastic syndrome myeloproliferative disorder sickle cell anemia evan's syndrome down syndrome sarcoidosis demyelinating disease cerebral palsy and spinal muscle atrophy . organisms concomitantly isolated with m. pneumoniae from the respiratory tract included herpes simplex virus type 1 2 occasions adenovirus 2 occasions cytomegalo virus 1 occasion respiratory syncytial virus 1 occasion and bacterial isolates 2 occasions acinetobacter species 1 and enter obacter cloacae 1 . clinical manifestations associated with m. pneumoniae infections are summarized in table 2. pneumonia was more common than upper respiratory tract infections 57.5 versus 27.5 respectively . immunocompromised patients were more likely to present with pneumonia as opposed to upper respiratory tract infection or bronchiolitis than non-immunocompromised patients 8 9 versus 16 31 p 0.05 . similarly there was a tendency for patients 60 years of age or older to present with pneumonia more frequently than those below 60 4 4 versus 20 36 p 0.1 . of the 24 patients with clinically or radiologically confirmed pneumonia 19 79.2 had crepitations and only 6 25 had bronchial breath sounds on physical examination. of the 16 patients in whom wheezes were detected 9 56.3 were not known to have asthma or other obstructive airway disease. complications and outcome of patients are shown in table 3. of the 24 patients with pneumonia 21 87.5 were admitted to the hospital and 20 83.3 had comorbidities. all patients with upper respiratory tract infections 11 patients or bronchiolitis 2 patients had uneventful recovery. of the 24 patients with pneumonia 14 58.3 had uneventful recovery 4 16.7 recovered following some complications acute respiratory distress syndrome 2 respiratory failure 1 septic shock 1 3 12.5 died because of m pneumoniae infection and 3 12.5 died due to underlying comorbidities. the 3 patients who died of m pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities one had congestive heart failure the second had congenital heart disease and the third was a 3-months old infant born prematurely at 32 weeks of gestation who previously had 3 episodes of pneumonia due to other pathogens. mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of atypical pneumonia accounting for 5-23 of community-acquired pneumonia 1 2 3 4 5 in a study of 511 children with acute respiratory tract infection in riyadh saudi arabia mycoplasma pneumoniae was found to be the second most common causative agent after respiratory syncytial virus rsv accounting for 9 of all cases 8 in a study of 112 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia admitted to a military hospital in riyadh saudi arabia this organism accounted for 6 of all cases 9 in another retrospective study of 567 pneumonic episodes in adult patients from al-qassim area the organism accounted for 23 of all

lines of evidence support the contribution of no to lung injury in several disease models. on the basis of biochemical evidence it is often presumed that such no -dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte-derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation. because of the overwhelming literature on no generation and activities in the respiratory tract it would be beyond the scope of this commentary to review this area comprehensively. instead it focuses on recent evidence and concepts of the presumed contribution of no to inflammatory diseases of the lung.', 'body': \"since its discovery as a biological messenger molecule more than 10 years ago the gaseous molecule nitric oxide no is now well recognized for its involvement in diverse biological processes including vasodilation bronchodilation neurotransmission tumor surveillance antimicrobial defense and regulation of inflammatory-immune processes 1 2 3 . in the respiratory tract no is generated enzymically by three distinct isoforms of no synthase nos-1 nos-2 and nos-3 that are present to different extents in numerous cell types including airway and alveolar epithelial cells neuronal cells macrophages neutrophils mast cells and endothelial and smooth-muscle cells. in contrast with the other two nos isoforms nos-1 and nos-3 which are expressed constitutively and activated by mediator-induced or stress-induced cell activation nos-2 activity is primarily regulated transcriptionally and is commonly induced by bacterial products and pro-inflammatory cytokines. as such inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract such as asthma acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and bronchiectasis are commonly characterized by an increased expression of nos-2 within respiratory epithelial and inflammatory-immune cells and a markedly elevated local production of no presumably as an additional host defense mechanism against bacterial or viral infections. the drawback of such excessive no production is its accelerated metabolism to a family of potentially harmful reactive nitrogen species rns including peroxynitrite onoo- and nitrogen dioxide no2 especially in the presence of phagocyte-generated oxidants. the formation of such rns is thought to be the prime reason why no can in many cases contribute to the etiology of inflammatory lung disease 4 5 6 . despite extensive research into both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory actions of no the overall contribution of no to inflammatory conditions of the lung is not easily predicted and seems to depend on many factors such as the site time and degree of no production in relation to the local redox status and the acute or chronic nature of the immune response. in addition our current understanding of the pro-inflammatory or pro-injurious mechanisms of no or related rns is incomplete this commentary will focus primarily on these latter aspects. to explore a role for no or nos in infectious or inflammatory diseases two general research approaches have been taken the use of pharmacological inhibitors of nos isoenzymes and the targeted deletion of individual nos enzymes in mice. both approaches suffer from the shortcoming that animal models of respiratory tract diseases generally do not faithfully reflect human disease. the use of nos inhibitors to determine the contribution of individual nos isoenzymes is also hindered by problems related to specificity and pharmacokinetic concerns. however the unconditional gene disruption of one or more nos isoforms leading to lifelong deficiency can have a markedly different outcome from pharmacological inhibition at a certain stage of disease as the involvement of individual nos isoenzymes can be different depending on disease stage and severity. despite these inherent limitations studies with the targeted deletion of nos isoforms have led to some insights indicating a role for no and nos-2 in the etiology of some inflammatory lung diseases. for instance mice deficient in nos-2 are less susceptible to lethality after intranasal inoculation with influenza a virus suffer less lung injury after administration of endotoxin and display reduced allergic eosinophilia in airways and lung injury in a model of asthma than their wild-type counterparts 7 8 9 . however although the contribution of nos-2 is expected in inflammatory conditions recent studies have determined that nos-1 rather than nos-2 seems to be primarily involved in the development of airway hyper-reactivity in a similar asthma model 10 . the linkage of nos-1 to the etiology of asthma was more recently supported in asthmatic humans by an association of a nos-1 gene polymorphism with this disease although the physiological basis for this association remains unclear 11 . despite the potential contribution of nos-2-derived no to lung injury after endotoxemia the sequestration of neutrophils in the lung and their adhesion to postcapillary and postsinusoidal venules after administration of endotoxin were found to be markedly increased in nos-2-deficient mice and nos-2 deficiency did not alleviate endotoxin-induced mortality. it therefore seems that the harmful' and protective' effects of nos-2 might contend with each other within the same model which makes the assessment of the potential role of nos in human disease even more difficult. in this context it is interesting to note that humans or animals with cystic fibrosis have subnormal levels of nos-2 in their respiratory epithelium related to a gene mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 12 . this relative absence of epithelial nos-2 might be one of the contributing factors behind the excessively exuberant respiratory tract inflammatory response in patients with cystic fibrosis even in the absence of detectable respiratory infections. overall the apparently contrasting findings associated with nos deficiency together with concerns about animal disease models used make interpretations and conclusions with regard to human lung disease all the more difficult. pharmacological inhibitors of nos have also been found to reduce oxidative injury in several animal models of lung injury such as ischemia reperfusion radiation paraquat toxicity and endotoxemia see for example 13 14 15 . however results are again not always consistent and in some cases nos inhibition has been found to worsen lung injury indicating anti-inflammatory or protective roles for no . all in all despite these inconsistencies there is ample evidence from such studies to suggest a contributing role of no in various respiratory disease conditions which continues to stimulate research into mechanistic aspects underlying such pro-inflammatory roles and modulation of no generation as a potential therapeutic target. although the pro-inflammatory and injurious effects of no might be mediated by a number of diverse mechanisms it is commonly assumed that such actions are largely due to the generation of reactive by-products generated during the oxidative metabolism of no these are collectively termed rns. one of the prime suspects commonly implicated in the adverse or injurious properties of no is onoo- a potent oxidative species formed by its almost diffusion-limited reaction with superoxide o2 - which is a product of activated phagocytes and of endothelial or epithelial cells 4 5 13 . the formation of onoo- seems highly feasible under conditions of elevated production of both no and o2 -in vivo and its oxidative and cytotoxic potential is well documented 5 6 . however because the direct detection of onoo- under inflammatory conditions is virtually impossible because of its instability and high reactivity the formation of onoo-in vivo can be demonstrated only by indirect methods. thus many investigators have relied on the analysis of characteristic oxidation products in biological molecules such as proteins and dna most notably free or protein-associated 3-nitrotyrosine a product of tyrosine oxidation that can be formed by onoo- and several other rns but not by no itself see for example 5 . indeed elevated levels of 3-nitrotyrosine have been observed in many different inflammatory conditions of the respiratory tract 16 which illustrates the endogenous formation of onoo- or related rns in these cases. however without known evidence for functional consequences of protein tyrosine nitration the detection of 3-nitrotyrosine should not be regarded as direct proof of a pro-inflammatory role of no . moreover although the detection of 3-nitrotyrosine has in most cases been interpreted as conclusive evidence for the formation of onoo-in vivo see for example 17 it should be realized that other rns formed by alternative mechanisms might also contribute to endogenous tyrosine nitration. indeed it has recently become clear that the presence of inflammatory-immune cells and specifically their heme peroxidases myeloperoxidase mpo and eosinophil peroxidase epo can catalyze the oxidization of no and or its metabolite no2- to more reactive rns and thereby contribute to protein nitration 16 18 19 . this notion is further supported by the fact that 3-nitrotyrosine is commonly detected in tissues affected by active inflammation mostly in and around these phagocytic cells and macrophages which can also contain active peroxidases originating from apoptotic neutrophils or eosinophils. hence the detection of 3-nitrotyrosine in vivo cannot be used as direct proof of the formation of onoo- but merely indicates the formation of rns by multiple oxidative pathways possibly including onoo-but more probably involving the activity of phagocyte peroxidases 16 20 . in this regard a preliminary study with epo-deficient mice has recently demonstrated the critical importance of epo in the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine in a mouse model of asthma 21 . future studies with animals deficient in mpo and or epo will undoubtedly help to clarify this issue. given the considerable interest in 3-nitrotyrosine as a collective marker of the endogenous formation of no -derived rns the crucial question remains of whether the detection of 3-nitrotyrosine adequately reflects the toxic or injurious properties of no . the formation of onoo- or of other rns that can induce tyrosine nitration might in fact represent a mechanism of decreasing excessive levels of no that might exert pro-inflammatory actions by other mechanisms. for instance no can promote the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines or cyclo-oxygenase responsible for the formation of inflammatory prostanoids by mechanisms independent of onoo- 22 23 and the removal of no would minimize these responses. furthermore although onoo- or related no -derived oxidants can be cytotoxic or induce apoptosis these effects might not necessarily relate to their ability to cause protein nitration see for example 16 . for instance the bactericidal and cytotoxic properties of onoo- are minimized by the presence of co2 even though aromatic nitration and other radical-induced modifications are enhanced 5 . similarly the presence of no2- in the incubation medium decreases the cytotoxicity of mpo-derived hypochlorous acid hocl toward epithelial cells or bacteria despite increased tyrosine nitration of cellular proteins a van der vliet and m syvanen unpublished data . thus it would seem that the cytotoxic properties of no and or its metabolites might instead be mediated through preferred reactions with other biological targets and these might not necessarily be correlated with the degree of tyrosine nitration. the extent of nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in bronchial biopsies of asthmatic patients was correlated directly with measured levels of exhaled no and inversely with the provocation concentration for methacholine pc20 and forced expiratory volume in 1s 24 . however an immunohistochemical analysis of nitrotyrosine and apoptosis in pulmonary tissue samples from lung transplant recipients did not identify patients with an imminent risk of developing obliterative bronchiolitis 25 . it is therefore still unclear to what degree tyrosine nitration relates to disease progression. several studies with purified enzymes have suggested that nitration of critical tyrosine residues adversely affects enzyme activity but there is as yet no conclusive evidence in vivo for biological or cellular changes as a direct result of tyrosine nitration 16 20 . for instance tyrosine nitration was suggested to have an effect on cellular pathways by affecting cytoskeletal proteins or tyrosine phosphorylation thereby affecting processes involved in for example cell proliferation or differentiation 16 26 . recent studies have provided support for selective tyrosine nitration within certain proteins 27 28 and of selective cellular targets for nitration by rns see for example 29 30 and such specificity might indicate a potential physiological role for this protein modification. however in none of these cases could tyrosine nitration be linked directly to changes in enzyme function. chemical studies have indicated that tyrosine nitration by rns accounts for only a minor fraction of oxidant involved and reactions with other biological targets thiols selenoproteins or transition metal ions are much more prominent 5 6 . indeed the extent of tyrosine nitration in vivo is very low 1-1000 per 106 tyrosine residues according to best estimates 16 although different analytical methods used to detect 3-nitrotyrosine in biological systems have often given inconsistent results. it is important to note that recent rigorous studies have unveiled substantial sources of artifact during sample preparation which might frequently have led to an overestimation of tyrosine nitration in vivo in previous studies 31 . on the basis of current knowledge the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine seems to be merely a marker of no -derived oxidants with as yet questionable pathophysiological significance. in view of the low efficiency of tyrosine nitration by biological rns and the endogenous presence of variable factors that influence protein nitration antioxidants or other rns scavengers it seems unlikely that tyrosine nitration is a reliable mechanism of for example enzyme regulation. nevertheless the recent discovery of enzymic denitration' mechanisms that can reverse tyrosine nitration 32 merits further investigation of the possibility that tyrosine nitration might reflect a signaling pathway for example analogous to tyrosine phosphorylation or sulfation. the biological effects of no are mediated by various actions either by no itself or by secondary rns and the overall biochemistry of no is deceptively complex. moreover the metabolism and chemistry of no depend importantly on local concentrations and ph the recently described acidification of the airway surface in asthmatics 33 might significantly affect no metabolism in these patients. it is well known that interactions with the ion centers of iron or other transition metals are responsible for many of the signaling properties of no the activation of the heme enzyme guanylyl cyclase and the consequent formation of cgmp is involved not only in smooth-muscle relaxation but also in the activation of certain transcription factors the expression of several pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes including cytokines and cyclo-oxygenase and the production of respiratory mucus 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 . in addition to such direct signaling properties many actions of no might be due largely to secondary rns that can react with multiple additional targets in some cases forming nitroso or nitro adducts as potentially unique no -mediated signaling mechanisms. as discussed the formation of protein nitrotyrosine has been postulated as a potential rns-specific signaling pathway. even more interest has been given to the reversible s-nitros yl ation of protein cysteine residues which has been proposed to affect a number of redox-sensitive signaling pathways for example by the activation of p21ras or the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases 35 36 . similar modifications of reactive cysteine residues in transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κb or of caspases contribute to the regulation of gene expression and apoptosis 37 38 39 . the precise mechanisms leading to protein s-nitrosylation in vivo are still not clarified but might involve dinitrogen trioxide formed during the autoxidation of no iron-nitrosyl complexes and perhaps onoo- 16 changes in no metabolism during inflammatory lung diseases undoubtedly affect such no -dependent signaling pathways. in addition s-nitrosylation can be reversed by either enzymic thioredoxin or glutaredoxin or chemical metals or oxidants mechanisms and evidence is increasing that this reversible modification is complementary to more widely accepted oxidant-dependent redox signaling pathways 40 . the reported alterations in s-nitrosothiol levels in tracheal secretions of patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis further point to altered no metabolism in these cases and might provide new clues to the role of s-nitrosylation in controlling such disease processes 41 42 . unfortunately technical limitations to detect s-nitrosylation in specific protein targets in vivo have limited a full understanding of this potential signaling pathway further research in these areas can be expected to establish more clearly its significance in the pathophysiological properties of no . despite the by now overwhelming evidence for the increased formation of no and no -derived oxidants in many different lung diseases the exact contribution of no or its metabolites to inflammatory lung disease is still unclear. indeed no might have distinctly different roles in different stages of respiratory tract inflammatory diseases being pro-inflammatory or pro-injurious in acute and severe stages but perhaps being protective and anti-inflammatory in more stable conditions it is uncertain whether nos is a suitable therapeutic target in the management of inflammatory lung disease. caution is clearly needed when interpreting observations of tyrosine nitration in animal models of disease or in human tissues which does not automatically implicate onoo- as often thought but rather indicates the formation of rns by various mechanisms. furthermore animal models of chronic lung disease that usually reflect short-term or acute inflammation might not always be applicable to chronic airway diseases in humans. for instance phagocyte degranulation a common feature observed in association with human airway inflammatory diseases such as asthma does not seem to occur in mouse models of asthma 43 . therefore the importance of granule proteins such as heme peroxidases in the pathology of human airway diseases might not be adequately reflected in such animal models. more work with animal models more characteristic of human diseases or with biopsy materials from human subjects will be required to unravel the precise role of no in inflammatory lung disease and might establish more clearly whether the pharmacological inhibition of nos isoenzymes can be beneficial. this brings up the interesting paradox that despite presumed adverse roles of no in such inflammatory lung diseases as septic shock and ards no inhalation has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy to improve overall gas exchange 44 . intriguingly in a rat model of endotoxemia inhalation of no was found to reduce neutrophilic inflammation and protein nitration 45 again supporting the crucial involvement of inflammatory-immune cells in this protein modification. for a better assessment of the role of no in respiratory tract diseases in humans the production of rns and or characteristic markers would need to be more carefully monitored during various disease stages. care should be given to analytical techniques their quantitative capacity and the possibility of artifacts. the monitoring of exhaled no although convenient and non-invasive does not reflect the actual production or fate of no in the respiratory tract and is not well correlated with nos activity in the lung 46 . we therefore need to continue research into the local biochemistry of no in the lung taking into account the presence of secreted or phagocyte peroxidases and possible changes in local ph as in asthmatic airways 33 that might modulate no activity and metabolism. this might result in a better understanding of relationships between the various metabolic endproducts of no no2- no3- or nitroso and nitro adducts and its pro-inflammatory or injurious properties.\",

patients with an imminent risk of developing obliterative bronchiolitis 25 . it is therefore still unclear to what degree tyrosine nitration relates to disease progression. several studies with purified enzymes have suggested that nitration of critical tyrosine residues adversely affects enzyme activity but there is as yet no conclusive evidence in vivo for biological or cellular changes as a direct result of tyrosine nitration 16 20 . for instance tyrosine nitration was suggested to have an effect on cellular pathways by affecting cytoskeletal proteins or tyrosine phosphorylation thereby affecting processes involved in for example cell proliferation or differentiation 16 26 . recent studies have provided support for selective tyrosine nitration within certain proteins 27 28 and of selective cellular targets for nitration by rns see for example 29 30 and such specificity might indicate a potential physiological role for this protein modification. however in none of these cases could tyrosine nitration be linked directly to changes in enzyme function. chemical studies have indicated that tyrosine nitration by rns accounts for only a minor fraction of oxidant involved and reactions with other biological targets thiols selenoproteins or transition metal ions are much more prominent 5 6 . indeed the extent of tyrosine nitration in vivo is very low 1-1000 per 106 tyrosine residues according to best estimates 16 although different analytical methods used to detect 3-nitrotyrosine in biological systems have often given inconsistent results. it is important to note that recent rigorous studies have unveiled substantial sources of artifact during sample preparation which might frequently have led to an overestimation of tyrosine nitration in vivo in previous studies 31 . on the basis of current knowledge the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine seems to be merely a marker of no -derived oxidants with as yet questionable pathophysiological significance. in view of the low efficiency of tyrosine nitration by biological rns and the endogenous presence of variable factors that influence protein nitration antioxidants or other rns scavengers it seems unlikely that tyrosine nitration is a reliable mechanism of for example enzyme regulation. nevertheless the recent discovery of enzymic denitration' mechanisms that can reverse tyrosine nitration 32 merits further investigation of the possibility that tyrosine nitration might reflect a signaling pathway for example analogous to tyrosine phosphorylation or sulfation. the biological effects of no are mediated by various actions either by no itself or by secondary rns and the overall biochemistry of no is deceptively complex. moreover the metabolism and chemistry of no depend importantly on local concentrations and ph the recently described acidification of the airway surface in asthmatics 33 might significantly affect no metabolism in these patients. it is well known that interactions with the ion centers of iron or other transition metals are responsible for many of the signaling properties of no the activation of the heme enzyme guanylyl cyclase and the consequent formation of cgmp is involved not only in smooth-muscle relaxation but also in the activation of certain transcription factors the expression of several pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes including cytokines and cyclo-oxygenase and the production of respiratory mucus 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 . in addition to such direct signaling properties many actions of no might be due largely to secondary rns that can react with multiple additional targets in some cases forming nitroso or nitro adducts as potentially unique no -mediated signaling mechanisms. as discussed the formation of protein nitrotyrosine has been postulated as a potential rns-specific signaling pathway. even more interest has been given to the reversible s-nitros yl ation of protein cysteine residues which has been proposed to affect a number of redox-sensitive signaling pathways for example by the activation of p21ras or the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases 35 36 . similar modifications of reactive cysteine residues in transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κb or of caspases contribute to the regulation of gene expression and apoptosis 37 38 39 . the precise mechanisms leading to protein s-nitrosylation in vivo are still not clarified but might involve dinitrogen trioxide formed during the autoxidation of no iron-nitrosyl complexes and perhaps onoo- 16 changes in no metabolism during inflammatory lung diseases undoubtedly affect such no -dependent signaling pathways. in addition s-nitrosylation can be reversed by either enzymic thioredoxin or glutaredoxin or chemical metals or oxidants mechanisms and evidence is increasing that this reversible modification is complementary to more widely accepted oxidant-dependent redox signaling pathways 40 . the reported alterations in s-nitrosothiol levels in tracheal secretions of patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis further point to altered no metabolism in these cases and might provide new clues to the role of s-nitrosylation in controlling such disease processes 41 42 . unfortunately technical limitations to detect s-nitrosylation in specific protein targets in vivo have limited a full understanding of this potential signaling pathway further research in these areas can be expected to establish more clearly its significance in the pathophysiological properties of no . despite the by now overwhelming evidence for the increased formation of no and no -derived oxidants in many different lung diseases the exact contribution of no or its metabolites to inflammatory lung disease is still unclear. indeed no might have distinctly different roles in different stages of respiratory tract inflammatory diseases being pro-inflammatory or pro-injurious in acute and severe stages but perhaps being protective and anti-inflammatory in more stable conditions it is uncertain whether nos is a suitable therapeutic target in the management of inflammatory lung disease. caution is clearly needed when interpreting observations of tyrosine nitration in animal models of disease or in human tissues which does not automatically implicate onoo- as often thought but rather indicates the formation of rns by various mechanisms. furthermore animal models of chronic lung disease that usually reflect short-term or acute inflammation might not always be applicable to chronic airway diseases in humans. for instance phagocyte degranulation a common feature observed in association with human airway inflammatory diseases such as asthma does not seem to occur in mouse models of asthma 43 . therefore the importance of granule proteins such as heme peroxidases in the pathology of human airway diseases might not be adequately reflected in such animal models. more work with animal models more characteristic of human diseases or with biopsy materials from human subjects will be required to unravel the precise role of no in inflammatory lung disease and might establish more clearly whether the pharmacological inhibition of nos isoenzymes can be beneficial. this brings up the interesting paradox that despite presumed adverse roles of no in such inflammatory lung diseases as septic shock and ards no inhalation has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy to improve overall gas exchange 44 . intriguingly in a rat model of endotoxemia inhalation of no was found to reduce neutrophilic inflammation and protein nitration 45 again supporting the crucial involvement of inflammatory-immune cells in this protein modification. for a better assessment of the role of no in respiratory tract diseases in humans the production of rns and or characteristic markers would need to be more carefully monitored during various disease stages. care should be given to analytical techniques their quantitative capacity and the possibility of artifacts. the monitoring of exhaled no although convenient and non-invasive does not reflect the actual production or fate of no in the respiratory tract and is not well correlated with nos activity in the lung 46 . we therefore need to continue research into the local biochemistry of no in the lung taking into account the presence of secreted or phagocyte peroxidases and possible changes in local ph as in asthmatic airways 33 that might modulate no activity and metabolism. this might result in a better understanding of relationships between the various metabolic endproducts of no no2- no3- or nitroso and nitro adducts and its pro-inflammatory or injurious properties.\"}}\n",

participates in the innate response to inhaled microorganisms and organic antigens and contributes to immune and inflammatory regulation within the lung. sp-d is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. sp-d a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin or collectin binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. sp-d also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages neutrophils and lymphocytes. in addition sp-d binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that sp-d-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. the phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of sp-d-deficient mice is altered and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. the expression of sp-d is increased in response to many forms of lung injury and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized sp-d might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.', 'body': \"surfactant protein-d sp-d is a member of the collagenous subfamily of calcium-dependent lectins collectins that includes pulmonary surfactant protein a sp-a and the serum mannose-binding lectin 1 2 3 . collectins interact with a wide variety of microorganisms lipids and organic particulate antigens and can modulate the function of immune effector cells and their responses to these ligands. this article reviews what is currently known about the sites of production structure function and regulated expression of sp-d. emphasis will be placed on functional attributes known ligand interactions and structure-function relationships believed to be important for host defense. for additional information on sp-a and other members of the collectin family the reader is referred to other recent reviews 4 5 6 . sp-d is synthesized and secreted into the airspaces of the lung by the respiratory epithelium 1 . at the alveolar level sp-d is constitutively synthesized and secreted by alveolar type ii cells. more proximally in the lung sp-d is secreted by a subset of bronchiolar epithelial cells the non-ciliated clara cells. because sp-d is stored within the secretory granules of clara cells 7 8 it seems likely that sp-d is subject to regulated secretion via granule exocytosis at this level of the respiratory tract. in some species sp-d is also synthesized by epithelial cells and or submucosal glands associated with the bronchi and trachea 9 . although many alveolar macrophages show strong cytoplasmic and or membrane labeling with antibody against sp-d they do not contain detectable sp-d message. the lung seems to be the major site of sp-d production. however there is increasing evidence for extrapulmonary sites of expression as assessed with monoclonal or affinity-purified antibodies reverse-transcriptase-mediated pcr rt-pcr and or hybridization assays of tissues from humans and other large mammals 10 11 12 13 14 summarized in table 1 . it is difficult to entirely exclude cross-reactions or amplification of related sequences however localization to many of these sites in human tissues was confirmed by using monoclonal antibodies in combination with rt-pcr with sequencing of the amplified products 10 . non-pulmonary expression seems to be largely restricted to cells lining epithelial surfaces or ducts and certain glandular epithelial cells that are in direct or indirect continuity with the environment. notable exceptions to this generalization might include heart brain pancreatic islets and testicular leydig cells. sp-d has also been identified in amnionic epithelial cells by immunohistochemistry 15 however it is unclear whether this is synthesized locally or derived from the lung by way of the amniotic fluid. interestingly in many of these sites sp-d microscopically co-localizes with gp-340 an sp-d binding protein and putative sp-d receptor 10 . sites of extrapulmonary expression have also been described in small mammals. in the rat sp-d message was identified in rna extracted from skin and blood vessel 16 and both protein and message were identified in gastric mucosa 17 and mesentery 13 . using rt-pcr sp-d message has also been identified in mouse stomach heart and kidney 14 . recent crystallographic and mutagenesis studies suggest that the structural determinants of saccharide binding are similar to those originally described for mannose-binding lectin 19 20 21 22 . at least two bound calcium ions and two intrachain disulfide crosslinks stabilize the required tertiary structure and glu321 and asn323 within the crd participate in glucose mannose type recognition. interactions with at least one glycolipid ligand phosphatidylinositol pi require the participation of the c-terminal end of the protein 23 24 . a trimeric cluster of crds is necessary for high-affinity binding to carbohydrate ligands 21 25 . the crystal structure of human sp-d suggests that the spatial distribution of crds within a trimeric subunit permits simultaneous and cooperative interactions with two or three glycoconjugates displayed on the surface of a particulate ligand 21 . furthermore solid-phase binding studies have shown that monomeric crds have an approximately 10-fold lower binding affinity for multivalent ligands than trimeric crds. crystallographic studies of human sp-d further suggest that the spatial organization of crds within a trimer is stabilized by interactions of the c-terminal sequence with the trimeric neck domain 21 26 . interestingly the three crds show a deviation from threefold asymmetry suggesting some flexibility of the crds in relation to the neck. thus the dependence of the binding of pi on the c-terminal sequence could reflect conformational effects rather than the direct participation of this sequence in ligand interactions. the collagen domain length of sp-d is highly conserved and lacks interruptions in the repeating gly-x-y sequence in which x and y are different amino acids . as for other collagenous proteins this domain is enriched in imino acids and contains hydroxyproline. unlike sp-a sp-d also contains hydroxylysine. although the collagen domain of rat human bovine and mouse sp-d lacks cysteine residues cdna sequencing has identified a codon for cysteine within the collagen domain of pig sp-d 27 this suggests the possibility of alternative patterns of chain association and oligomeric assembly for pig sp-d. the first translated exon of sp-d contains a highly conserved and unusually hydrophilic gly-x-y sequence that shows little homology with the remainder of the collagen sequence. the functional significance of this region is unknown. however it has been suggested that this region contributes to oligomer assembly or mediates interactions with cellular receptors. the collagen domain determines the maximal spatial separation of trimeric c-terminal lectin domains within sp-d molecules but might also contribute to normal oligomeric assembly and secretion. for example deletion of the entire collagen domain of rat sp-d results in the secretion of trimers rather than dodecamers 28 . in addition 2 2-dipyridyl an inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylation that interferes with the formation of a stable collagen helix causes the intracellular accumulation of 43 kda monomers and dimers 29 . in any case the complete conservation of the number of gly-x-y triplets suggests that the spatial separation of trimeric crds is critical for normal sp-d function. the n-terminal peptide of the mature protein contains two conserved cysteine residues at positions 15 and 20. these residues participate in interchain disulfide crosslinks that stabilize the trimer as well as the n-terminal association of four or more trimeric subunits. stable oligomerization of trimeric subunits permits cooperative or bridging interactions between spatially separated binding sites on the same surface or on different particles. the process of forming interchain disulfide bonds is complex and appropriate crosslinking of the n-terminal domains might be rate limiting for secretion 30 . subcellular fractionation studies suggest that interchain bonds form initially between the three chains of a trimeric subunit. subsequent rearrangements within the rough endoplasmic reticulum might allow the covalent crosslinking of a single chain from one subunit and two crosslinked chains of another with the associated elimination of free thiol groups. mutant proteins that contain unpaired n-terminal cysteine residues are not secreted. however it is unclear whether this results from abnormalities in disulfide bonding itself or the failure to stabilize the required n-terminal conformation. the collagen domain contains hydroxylysyl-derived glycosides and a single n-linked oligosaccharide. in most species human rat mouse and cow the site of n-linked glycosylation is located near the n-terminal end of the collagenous domain. recently it was shown that pig sp-d has an additional potential site of n-linked glycosylation within the crd 27 . although rat and human lung lavage sp-d seem to be sialylated as suggested by charge heterogeneity and cleavage with highly purified neuraminidase preparations of human amniotic fluid and bovine lavage sp-d recovered from amniotic fluid showed predominantly complex type biantennary structures and no sialic acid 31 . a variant form of sp-d 50 kda has been identified in lavage from a subset of human lavage samples this protein shows o-linked glycosylation of threonyl residues within the n-terminal peptide domain 32 . at present the functional significance of these sugars is not known. the presence of o-linked glycosylation within the n-terminal domain might be predicted to interfere with normal dodecamer assembly. in this regard the o-glycosylated 50 kda form of human sp-d is recovered as trimeric subunits or smaller species. as for many glycoproteins the functional role of the attached carbohydrate is unknown. mutational analysis has shown that the n-linked sugar on rat sp-d is not required for secretion for dodecamer formation or for interactions with a variety of microorganisms 29 33 . consistent with its designation as a mannose-type' c-type lectin sp-d preferentially binds to simple and complex saccharides containing mannose glucose or inositol 34 35 . sp-d also interacts with specific constituents of pulmonary surfactant including pi 36 37 38 and glucosylceramide 39 . binding to glucosylceramide involves interactions of the carbohydrate-binding sequences of the crd with the glucosyl moiety. however the interaction of sp-d with pi involves interactions with the lipid as well as crd-dependent interactions with the inositol moiety 24 40 . microorganisms are surfaced with a diverse and complex array of polysaccharides and glycoconjugates and most classes of microorganism contain one or more sugars recognized by sp-d. however the outcome of this interaction depends on the specific organism and can be modified by the conditions of microbial growth. the potential consequences of this interaction include the following varying degrees of lectin-dependent aggregation namely microbial agglutination enhanced binding of microorganisms or microbial aggregates to their receptors' on host cells phagocyte activation and opsonic enhancement of phagocytosis and killing potentially involving one or more cellular receptors for sp-d. sp-d binds to purified lipopolysaccharide lps isolated from a variety of gram-negative organisms 35 41 . in addition lps is the major cell wall component that is labeled on lectin blotting of outer membranes isolated from escherichia coli 41 . the latter interactions involve the recognition of the core oligosaccharide domain which contains glucose and heptose 41 . sp-d interacts preferentially with purified lps molecules characterized by short or absent o-antigens and preferentially agglutinates bacterial strains expressing a predominance of rough o-antigen-deficient lps 41 44 . although the core oligosaccharide domain of lps constitutes the major ligand for sp-d on at least some gram-negative bacteria the mechanism of interaction with this group of microorganisms is probably heterogeneous. sp-d binds to some smooth unencapsulated strains of gram-negative bacteria by immunofluorescence. the mechanism is uncertain the quantity or quality of binding differs from that observed for rough strains and does not necessarily result in agglutination. lps molecules on the surfaces of bacteria show heterogeneity in the extent of maturation so it is possible that this interaction is mediated by a subpopulation of lps with deficient o-antigens and that the density of binding sites is too low for high-affinity binding. the recognition of the surface glycoconjugates on gram-negative bacteria by sp-d depends not only on the expression of lectin-specific residues by a given strain or species but also on the accessibility of these residues 1 45 . for example sp-d binds inefficiently to the core region of lps of encapsulated klebsiella but efficiently agglutinates the corresponding unencapsulated phase variants. interactions of sp-d with the core oligosaccharides of gram-negative organisms are also influenced by the number of repeating saccharide units associated with the terminal o-antigen of the lps 41 44 . other potential ligands include the o-antigen domain of lps certain capsular polysaccharides and membrane-associated glycoproteins. in this regard sp-d can bind to di-mannose containing o-antigens expressed by a subset of klebsiella serotypes i ofek h sahly and ec crouch unpublished data . although other c-type lectins specifically sp-a and the mannose receptor can interact with specific capsular polysaccharides 46 a specific interaction of sp-d with capsular glycoconjugates or exopolysaccharides has not been described. the mechanism of interaction with gram-positive organisms has not been elucidated. lipoteichoic acids which are the major glycolipids associated with the gram-positive cell wall do not detectably compete with lps for binding to sp-d i ofek a mesika m kalina y keisari d chang d mcgregor and ec crouch manuscript submitted . in preliminary studies we observed that binding was competed only partly with maltose and or edta raising the possibility that binding might be more complex than for some gram-negative organisms. recently sp-d was shown to interact with the terminal mannosyl-oligosaccharides of lipoarabinomannan from mycobacterium tuberculosis 43 . the consequences of binding with regard to host cell function are not always predictable. opsonization of mucoid strains of p. aeruginosa with rat sp-d enhanced the internalization by alveolar macrophages and these experiments further suggested the involvement of a cellular receptor for sp-d 47 . interestingly the organisms were not detectably aggregated by sp-d. similarly human sp-d enhanced the internalization and killing of unencapsulated phase variants of klebsiella pneumoniae 45 i ofek a mesika m kalina y keisari d chang d mcgregor and ec crouch manuscript submitted . however unlike the situation reported for p. aeruginosa the organisms showed varying degrees of aggregation some of the largest aggregates were identified in association with the macrophage membrane but were not internalized. in other studies human proteinosis sp-d did not enhance the internalization of e. coli j5 a rough laboratory strain by rat alveolar macrophages despite efficient bacterial agglutination 48 . in addition sp-d inhibited the adherence of mycobacterium tuberculosis to monocyte-derived macrophages despite efficient microbial aggregation 43 . rat and human sp-d enhanced the binding and uptake of e. coli k12 streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus by human neutrophils 42 . however similar effects were observed when the neutrophils were preincubated with sp-d and there was only a slight enhancement of uptake when bacteria were incubated with human sp-d and washed before their addition to neutrophils. notably the extent of binding and internalization was dependent on the extent of multimerization with human sp-d multimers demonstrating the highest potency. differences in cell type the extent of sp-d multimerization or differences in size or organization of bacterial aggregates could account for some of the apparent inconsistencies. although lps mediates the binding of sp-d to at least some gram-negative bacteria sp-d can also bind to specific forms of soluble lps particularly rough' or o-antigen-deficient forms 35 41 44 . because soluble lps can modulate a variety of cellular responses and is the key mediator of gram-negative sepsis such interactions could have considerable biological significance. several observations suggest a potential protective role of sp-d in the host response to endotoxin. for example sp-d can bind to intratracheally instilled lps in rats and the resulting complexes are rapidly internalized into lysosomal compartments in alveolar macrophages 49 . in addition as discussed below preliminary studies suggest that transgenic mice deficient in sp-d develop more intense inflammation in response to intratracheal challenge with lps 50 . of particular interest is the recent observation that sp-d can bind directly to oligosaccharides on scd14 a soluble form of one component of the lps receptor complex and modify its interactions with lps 51 . although sp-a can bind to lps the interaction is mechanistically different and involves interactions with the lipid a domain and perhaps saccharides associated with certain o-antigens. human sp-a but not sp-d increases the uptake and deacylation of tritiated e. coli lps by isolated alveolar macrophages 52 but the biological significance of this finding is uncertain. sp-d binds in a crd-dependent manner to gpa gp-140 a heavily mannosylated glycoprotein associated with the trophozoites and cysts of pneumocystis carinii 53 . sp-d can also bind to cell wall β-glucans 54 . sp-d binding enhances the association of pneumocystis carinii with rat alveolar macrophages however the bound organisms are not efficiently internalized or killed in vitro 53 . sp-d interacts with most of the clinically important fungal pathogens including cryptococcus neoformans aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans 55 56 57 . we have also observed binding to clinical isolates of histoplasma capsulatum and blastomyces dermatitidis sf kuan s moser and e crouch unpublished data . in all cases reported so far binding is accompanied by agglutination. in particular sp-d efficiently agglutinates aspergillus fumigatus conidia 55 and candida albicans 57 . although sp-d also shows crd-dependent agglutination of unencapsulated forms of cryptococcus neoformans no significant binding to encapsulated organisms was observed 56 . there is still relatively little information on the mechanism of sp-d binding to fungi. however sp-d shows crd-dependent binding to the n-linked sugars of specific cell wall glycoproteins including major glycoprotein allergens of aspergillus fumigatus 55 . because sp-d shows lectin-dependent binding to wild-type saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as to mutants with low levels of mannosylphosphate in the cell wall the interactions probably do not involve n-linked phosphomannan sugars 58 . the observation that sp-d interacts with β-glucans on the surface of pneumocystis 54 suggests that these glycoconjugates which are abundant in the cell walls of true fungi could serve as ligands for sp-d. as for bacteria the effects of sp-d binding on the phagocytic response to fungi are somewhat controversial. human sp-d enhances the oxidative response to and internalization and killing of aspergillus fumigatus conidia by human alveolar macrophages and blood neutrophils 59 . however other investigators observed binding of rat and human sp-d to conidia but found no enhancement of internalization by rat alveolar macrophages 60 . furthermore rat sp-d inhibits the phagocytosis of candida albicans by these cells 57 . in the latter study the authors suggested that fungal aggregation inhibits phagocytosis. interestingly sp-d binding directly inhibited fungal growth and decreased the outgrowth of pseudohyphae the invasive form of the fungus in the absence of phagocytic cells 57 . it is possible that these effects are also secondary to agglutination possibly as result of nutrient deprivation. purified rat and human sp-d inhibit the infectivity and hemagglutination activity of influenza a virus iav in vitro 61 . this activity is calcium-dependent inhibited by carbohydrate ligands and involves the binding of sp-d to high-mannose oligosaccharides associated with the ha1domain of the hemagglutinin ha molecule. because the high-mannose oligosaccharide on the ha1 domain over-lies the sialic acid-binding pocket the cell attachment site of the ha binding can interfere sterically with ha activity and cellular attachment. sp-d also binds to the neuraminidase of iav and inhibits neuraminidase enzyme activity 62 . sp-d induces massive aggregation of iav particles 18 33 61 63 . viral aggregation is calcium-dependent inhibited by competing sugars and directly correlated with the multimerization state of sp-d. highly multimerized preparations of sp-d are significantly more potent than dodecamers. in particular minimal agglutination is induced with trimeric crds. massive agglutination of organisms could contribute to lung host defense by promoting airway mucociliary clearance but it might also influence the internalization by phagocytic cells. sp-d enhances the binding and uptake of iav by neutrophils 33 61 63 and these effects are highly dependent on the extent of multimerization of sp-d and its ability to agglutinate the viral particles 18 30 33 . the enhancement of viral binding and uptake is accompanied by attachment of large aggregates of virus to the neutrophil and the binding of iav or sp-d-iav aggregates is abrogated by pretreatment of the phagocyte with neuraminidase 63 . thus viral internalization involves enhanced binding of the virus to sialylated glycoconjugate ligands on the neutrophil surface. sp-d also potentiates iav-induced hydrogen peroxide responses in neutrophils and protects neutrophils from iav-induced inhibition of respiratory burst responses. interestingly sp-d does not increase the uptake of iav by rat alveolar macrophages 64 . thus there might be cell type specific effects of sp-d on phagocytic cells. notably human bronchoalveolar lavage bal contains sufficient concentrations of sp-d to inhibit iav ha activity in vitro and depletion of sp-d from bal reduces its ha inhibitory activity 61 . sp-d can also interact with other respiratory viruses. for example natural sp-d and a recombinant trimeric sp-d bind to the rous sarcoma virus g protein in vitro and inhibit viral infectivity in vivo 65 . these studies suggest that crd-dependent binding but not aggregation is required to mediate the antiviral effect. in addition bovine sp-d inhibits the infectivity of rotaviruses through calcium-dependent mannose-inhibitable attachment to the major viral envelope glycoprotein 66 . as indicated above the ability of sp-d to elicit the chemotaxis of neutrophilic and monocytic cells depends on the lectin activity of sp-d 68 . in addition kuan and coworkers reported that extracting formaldehyde-fixed alveolar macrophages with detergents largely eliminates the binding of purified sp-d suggesting a membrane-associated ligand or glycolipid receptor 73 . dong and wright have extended these findings and suggest that pi can contribute to sp-d binding by alveolar macrophages 74 . it is of interest that sp-d can bind to recombinant scd14 through interactions with n-linked oligosaccharides 51 . given that the membrane-associated form of cd14 is widely expressed on host cells it is possible that cd14 can serve as a binding site on macrophages and other cell types. the phagocytic uptake of certain bacteria by neutrophils is also inhibited by calcium chelation or competing sugars 42 however this could result from the inhibition of microbial agglutination rather than lectin-dependent interactions with the phagocyte. wang et al suggested that sp-d can bind to lymphocytic cells by a lectin-dependent mechanism 75 . in this regard it is interesting to note that glucosylceramide a ligand for sp-d in vitro is one of the most abundant neutral glycolipids expressed by lymphoid cells. reid and co-workers were the first to present evidence for lectin-independent binding 76 . these and other studies suggested that binding does not involve known c1q or collectin receptors. the only putative receptor protein gp-340 is a widely expressed member of the scavenger receptor superfamily 77 78 . it binds to the crd of sp-d in a calcium-dependent manner that does not require the lectin activity of sp-d. although the protein has been immunolocalized to alveolar macrophage membranes and distributes together with sp-d in many different human tissues 10 77 it has not yet been shown to mediate the binding of sp-d to these cells or to participate in signal transduction events. the cdnas isolated from lung have not shown a membrane-spanning region 77 and the protein is abundant as a soluble component in bal. given that gp-340 is a highly multimerized protein that contains numerous potential ligand binding domains fig. 1b it is possible that the protein cooperates with sp-d in the neutralization or clearance of certain ligands rather than specifically mediating the interactions of sp-d with host cells. wright and co-workers have demonstrated the binding of sp-d to isolated type ii pneumocytes. the mechanism seems distinct from the binding to macrophages 79 . the binding was dependent on concentration time and temperature and required calcium it was not sensitive to protease treatment or to pi-phospholipase c. although the internalized sp-d was degraded or recycled to lamellar bodies sp-d binding did not alter the uptake of surfactant lipids. sp-d has demonstrated comparatively few direct effects on the metabolism of host cells at least in situations where self-aggregation and endotoxin contamination have been excluded. one possible explanation is that modulation of cellular function requires the prior interaction of sp-d with a ligand. this would have numerous potential physiological advantages because the presence of active' protein might be restricted to sites of microbial or antigenic deposition. the binding of complex multivalent particulate antigens to two or more crds could markedly alter the conformation of sp-d molecules with respect to the spatial orientation of the arms in relation to the n-terminal crosslinking domain and or with respect to the spatial orientation of the crds within a given trimeric subunit. thus the charging' of sp-d with a particulate ligand could lead to local or distant conformational changes that expose cryptic' binding sites for cellular receptors. there is some preliminary evidence consistent with the notion that the interaction of sp-d with a ligand alters its capacity to activate host cells. for example ofek et al have examined the effects of sp-d lps and lps-coated latex beads on the production of nitric oxide by alveolar macrophage-like cells i ofek a mesika m kalina y keisari d chang d mcgregor and ec crouch manuscript submitted . under conditions in which sp-d lps latex beads or latex beads coated with sp-d or lps were no more than minimally stimulatory the opsonization of lps-coated latex beads with sp-d resulted in a marked increase in no production i ofek a mesika m kalina y keisari d chang d mcgregor and ec crouch manuscript submitted . although these effects can be abrogated with competing sugars it is unclear whether the inhibitory effect of competing sugars involves the disruption of the interaction of sp-d with the ligand the host cell or both. all the effects could be secondary to altered presentation of the aggregated particles to receptors for the particulate ligand on the host cell. thus it is unclear whether one needs to invoke the participation of an sp-d receptor for many of its functions. it is well established that the binding of sp-d to iav particles leads to aggregation-dependent enhancement of viral binding to neutrophils with an increased oxidative response 45 . these effects involve the natural receptors for the virus on the neutrophil. significantly the effects on neutrophil function are blocked by enzymic destruction of the sialic acid-binding sites for the ha on the neutrophil membrane 63 suggesting that the effects of sp-d do not require cellular recognition of the bound protein. aggregation might also be important for mediating the interactions of neutrophils with some bacteria 42 . particle aggregation might be particularly important for other aspects of sp-d function. the relatively large spatial separation of crds seems highly suited to bridging interactions between particles with resultant aggregation as demonstrated by experiments with iav. particle aggregation could similarly contribute to the metabolism of certain subfractions of surfactant lipid. for example poulain et al have shown that sp-d can mediate the formation of characteristic tubular configurations of lipid mixtures containing pi 80 . similar structures have been identified in association with type ii cells in culture and in alveolar proteinosis lavage. in addition persson et al demonstrated the aggregation of pi-containing liposomes 36 . sp-d can be isolated in different multimeric forms from proteinosis lavage 32 and are produced by chinese hamster ovary k1 cells transfected with human sp-d cdna 18 . as described previously the effects of sp-d on the neutrophil response to influenza virus are highly dependent on the ability of sp-d to agglutinate the viral particles and the agglutination activity is directly correlated with the extent of multimerization. trimers can bind to the virus but have little capacity to modulate neutrophil interactions. by contrast highly multimerized proteins show greater activity than dodecamers 81 . given these observations factors that favor enhanced oligomerization or lead to the accumulation of trimeric subunits promote might influence sp-d function. for example the liberation of active trimers by a hypothetical microbial protease could lead to the accumulation of molecules that might inhibit the aggregation-dependent activities of sp-d. in contrast recombinant trimeric crds can stimulate chemotaxis 67 and decrease viral infectivity 65 . although higher-order oligomers of sp-d can self-aggregate and precipitate in the presence of calcium in vitro the functional consequences are not known. the lectin activity of sp-a is decreased after the nitric oxide-dependent nitration of tyrosine residues 82 and nitration decreases the ability of sp-a to enhance the adherence of pneumocystis to alveolar macrophages 83 . however similar findings have not yet been reported for sp-d. conditions of mildly acidic ph as might be found in endocytic compartments are predicted to disrupt the lectin-dependent activities of sp-d 34 . proteolytic degradation remains an important possibility. however sp-d is highly resistant to degradation by a wide variety of neutral proteases in vitro and degradation products have not yet been shown to accumulate under pathological conditions in vivo. glucose concentrations at levels encountered in diabetes can interfere with sp-d's ability to interact with specific strains of iav or other microorganisms in vitro 84 . many microorganisms release cell wall polysaccharides or glycoconjugates which might interfere with the binding of collectins to the same or other organisms. in this regard sp-d recovered from rats after the instillation of lps into the airway shows decreased lectin activity which is attributed to occupancy of the crd with lps 49 . it seems reasonable to speculate that some organisms might compete with other organisms for binding to sp-d. such a situation could conceivably predispose to secondary infections. lastly the potential inhibitory effects of competing saccharide ligands presents important methodological considerations for experiments using carbohydrate-containing cell culture medium or buffers. it is difficult to predict the functions of sp-d within the airspace. other lectins with overlapping specificity are also present. although the levels of mannose-binding lectin are probably low in the absence of increased vascular permeability sp-a and the macrophage mannose receptor could conceivably interact with the same ligands in the distal airways and alveoli. such interactions could lead to antagonistic or cooperative effects. furthermore we have little knowledge regarding the microanatomic distribution of these molecules in specific circumstances in vivo. although most sp-a is probably associated with the insoluble phase of the alveolar lining material and the macrophage mannose receptor is membrane-associated the distribution might be altered in the setting of lung injury. models of sp-d deficiency show no detectable anatomical or physiological abnormalities at birth. however the animals gradually develop a patchy subpleural alveolar lipidosis with associated type ii cell hypertrophy the accumulation of enlarged and foamy macrophages and an apparent expansion of peribronchial lymphoid tissue 85 86 . interestingly the mice eventually develop distal-acinar emphysema and areas of subpleural fibrosis which could reflect a continuing inflammatory reaction associated with abnormal oxidant metabolism and metalloproteinase activity 87 . by contrast sp-a-deficient mice - - show essentially normal respiratory function and surfactant lipid metabolism 88 89 but numerous apparent host defense abnormalities 90 . the capacity of sp-d to bind to specific strains of influenza a in vitro is highly correlated with the capacity of the virus to proliferate in mice in vivo 62 . specifically strains with more oligosaccharide attachments on the ha are preferentially neutralized by sp-d in vitro and show decreased proliferation in mice. because the administration of mannan together with the virus increased the replication of iav in the lung the involvement of a mannose-type c-type lectin was implicated. sp-d-sensitive iav strains also replicate to higher titers in the lungs of diabetic mice than in nondiabetic controls 84 . replication of the virus is positively correlated with blood glucose level and decreases in response to insulin treatment. significantly blood glucose levels comparable to those measured in the diabetic mice were sufficient to inhibit the interaction of sp-d with these viral strains in vitro. pr-8 a strain that does not interact with sp-d but does interact with sp-a replicated to the same extent in diabetic and control mice. sp-d levels increase in association with certain infections. for example sp-d levels but not the levels of serum mannose-binding lectin increase markedly after iav infection 62 . impressive increases in sp-d have also been observed in murine models of pneumocystis carinii 91 and p. aeruginosa infection 92 . sp-d-deficient mice have not yet been extensively characterized with respect to host defense function. however they show decreased viral clearance and enhanced inflammation after challenge with respiratory syncytial virus 93 and iav am levine personal communication . in addition they show increased inflammation increased oxidant production and decreased macrophage phagocytosis in response to intratracheally instilled group b streptococcus and haemophilus influenzae am levine personal communication . although the overexpression of wild-type sp-d in type ii pneumocytes with the sp-d-deficient mice can prevent the lipidosis and inflammatory changes 94 the ability of overexpressed wild-type sp-d or exogenous sp-d to ameliorate these abnormalities has not yet been described. the coexisting pulmonary abnormalities also complicate the interpretation of challenge models. for example macrophage activation might enhance killing and offset any decrease that results more directly from sp-d deficiency. sp-d deficiency modifies the host response to instilled lps with decreased lung injury and inflammatory cell recruitment 50 . molecules that can bind to potential antigens and deliver them to macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells might contribute to the development of acquired immunity. in this regard a few published observations suggest possible roles in the development of humoral and or cellular immunity in response to microorganisms or complex organic antigens. for example sp-d can decrease interleukin-2-dependent t-lymphocyte proliferation 95 . interestingly single-arm mutants were at least as potent as intact dodecamers in mediating this effect. sp-d also binds to oligosaccharides associated with dust mite allergen 96 and can inhibit the binding of specific ige to these allergens possibly through direct crd-dependent binding to lymphocytes 96 . thus alterations in the level of sp-d or the state of oligomerization might influence the development of immunological responses and contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma and other hypersensitivity disorders. there are other potential interplays between humoral immunity and collectins with regard to antimicrobial host defense. for example increased glycosylation of iav coat proteins an adaptation that is believed to help the virus to evade antibody-mediated neutralization is associated with increased reactivity with sp-d and other collectins 62 . thus the relative potential importance of antibody and col-lectin-mediated host defenses might be influenced by subtle variations in the structure of the microbial surface. there is little recent information on the developmental regulation of sp-d expression. in general sp-d increases rapidly late in gestation 97 98 99 100 . the production of sp-d increases during the culture of fetal lung explants and expression can be increased with glucocorticoids 98 100 101 . the exposure of fetal rats to glucocorticoids in vivo leads to precocious expression with increased numbers of sp-d-expressing cells and increased cellular levels of sp-d message 98 101 102 . although sp-d is produced constitutively within the lung protein accumulation and gene expression are inducible and increases in sp-d expression have been observed in a number of disease states or models tables 4 and 5 . in general the synthesis and secretion of sp-d increase in association with lung injury and activation of the respiratory epithelium 1 . for example levels of sp-d mrna and sp-d accumulation are increased within 24-72h after intratracheal instillation of lps 103 and sp-d expression by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells increases after exposure of rats to 95 o2 for 12 h 104 . keratinocyte growth factor kgf increases sp-d expression and protein production in association with pneumocyte hyperplasia and after injury caused by bleomycin 105 . in addition the levels of sp-d can increase markedly in response to the overexpression of certain cytokines such as interleukin-4 or in response to microbial challenge 91 92 . studies of the upstream regulatory region of the sp-d gene have demonstrated increased promoter activity in the presence of glucocorticoids which is consistent with the findings in vivo and in lung organ culture 106 . however no functional glucocorticoid response elements have been identified and the effects of dexamethasone seem to be secondary and involve the effects of other transregulatory molecules. the activity of the human sp-d promoter is dependent on a conserved activator protein-1 ap-1 element -109 that binds to members of the fos and jun families of transcriptional factors 107 . in addition the promoter contains multiple functional binding sites for ccaat-enhancer-binding protein c ebp transcription factors. mutagenesis experiments suggest that these are required for basal and stimulated promoter activity and promoter activity is markedly increased in h441 cells after co-transfection with c ebpβ cdna yc he and e crouch unpublished data . the importance of the conserved ap-1 element and the presence of multiple binding sites for c ebp transcription factors is consistent with the observed modulation of sp-d expression in the setting of tissue injury. sp-d promoter activity is not dependent on the binding of thyroid transcription factor 1 ttf-1 107 . however promoter activity is dependent on two interacting forkhead binding sites upstream and downstream of the ap-1 element these sites bind to hepatic nuclear factor-3α and apparently other forkhead box proteins in h441 lung adenocarcinoma nuclear extracts 107 . initial comparison of genomic and cdna sequence suggested the existence of genetic polymorphisms in the sp-d coding sequence including one in the n-terminal propeptide domain thr11 compared with met11 in the mature protein and three additional differences within the collagen domain at positions 102 160 and 186 108 . the latter substitutions are conservative to the extent that they are not expected to disrupt the collagen helix. floros and co-workers have recently confirmed the existence of polymorphisms at positions 11 and 160 of the mature protein 109 . the potential biological significance if any is not known. interestingly the 50 kda variant of sp-d showed o-linked glycosylation of thr11 32 suggesting that this polymorphism might be associated with altered glycosylation. interestingly the 50 kda variant was recovered as trimeric subunits raising the possibility that differences in the glycosylation of residue 11 which is immediately n-terminal to cys15 could influence multimerization and the capacity of sp-d to participate in bridging interactions. there is increasing evidence that sp-d interacts specifically with a wide variety of respiratory pathogens modulates the leukocyte response to these organisms and participates in aspects of pulmonary immune and inflammatory regulation table 6 . sp-d can influence the activity of phagocytes through crd-dependent and crd-independent interactions. at least some of the effects of sp-d result from aggregation with enhanced binding of the agglutinated ligand to their natural receptors'. although the lung is the major site of sp-d expression it is likely that the protein has more generalized roles in host defense and the acute response to infection and tissue injury.\", 'combined': \"surfactant protein-d and pulmonary host defense surfactant protein-d sp-d participates in the innate response to inhaled microorganisms and organic antigens and contributes to immune and inflammatory regulation within the lung. sp-d is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. sp-d a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin or collectin binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. sp-d also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages neutrophils and lymphocytes. in addition sp-d binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that sp-d-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. the phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of sp-d-deficient mice is altered and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. the expression of sp-d is increased in response to many forms of lung injury and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized sp-d might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases. surfactant protein-d sp-d is a member of the collagenous subfamily of calcium-dependent lectins collectins that includes pulmonary surfactant protein a sp-a and the serum mannose-binding lectin 1 2 3 . collectins interact with a wide variety of microorganisms lipids and organic particulate antigens and can modulate the function of immune effector cells and their responses to these ligands. this article reviews what is currently known about the sites of production structure function and regulated expression of sp-d. emphasis will be placed on functional attributes known ligand interactions and structure-function relationships believed to be important for host defense. for additional information on sp-a and other members of the collectin family the reader is referred to other recent reviews 4 5 6 . sp-d is synthesized and secreted into the airspaces of the lung by the respiratory epithelium 1 . at the alveolar level sp-d is constitutively synthesized and secreted by alveolar type ii cells. more proximally in the lung sp-d is secreted by a subset of bronchiolar epithelial cells the non-ciliated clara cells. because sp-d is stored within the secretory granules of clara cells 7 8 it seems likely that sp-d is subject to regulated secretion via granule exocytosis at this level of the respiratory tract. in some species sp-d is also synthesized by epithelial cells and or submucosal glands associated with the bronchi and trachea 9 . although many alveolar macrophages show strong cytoplasmic and or membrane labeling with antibody against sp-d they do not contain detectable sp-d message. the lung seems to be the major site of sp-d production. however there is increasing evidence for extrapulmonary sites of expression as assessed with monoclonal or affinity-purified antibodies reverse-transcriptase-mediated pcr rt-pcr and or hybridization assays of tissues from humans and other large mammals 10 11 12 13 14 summarized in table 1 . it is difficult to entirely exclude cross-reactions or amplification of related sequences however localization to many of these sites in human tissues was confirmed by using monoclonal antibodies in combination with rt-pcr with sequencing of the amplified products 10 . non-pulmonary expression seems to be largely restricted to cells lining epithelial surfaces or ducts and certain glandular epithelial cells that are in direct or indirect continuity with the environment. notable exceptions to this generalization might include heart brain pancreatic islets and testicular leydig cells. sp-d has also been identified in amnionic epithelial cells by immunohistochemistry 15 however it is unclear whether this is synthesized locally or derived from the lung by way of the amniotic fluid. interestingly in many of these sites sp-d microscopically co-localizes with gp-340 an sp-d binding protein and putative sp-d receptor 10 . sites of extrapulmonary expression have also been described in small mammals. in the rat sp-d message was identified in rna extracted from skin and blood vessel 16 and both protein and message were identified in gastric mucosa 17 and mesentery 13 . using rt-pcr sp-d message has also been identified in mouse stomach heart and kidney 14 . recent crystallographic and mutagenesis studies suggest that the structural determinants of saccharide binding are similar to those originally described for mannose-binding lectin 19 20 21 22 . at least two bound calcium ions and two intrachain disulfide crosslinks stabilize the required tertiary structure and glu321 and asn323 within the crd participate in glucose mannose type recognition. interactions with at least one glycolipid ligand phosphatidylinositol pi require the participation of the c-terminal end of the protein 23 24 . a trimeric cluster of crds is necessary for high-affinity binding to carbohydrate ligands 21 25 . the crystal structure of human sp-d suggests that the spatial distribution of crds within a trimeric subunit permits simultaneous and cooperative interactions with two or three glycoconjugates displayed on the surface of a particulate ligand 21 . furthermore solid-phase binding studies have shown that monomeric crds have an approximately 10-fold lower binding affinity for multivalent ligands than trimeric crds. crystallographic studies of human sp-d further suggest that the spatial organization of crds within a trimer is stabilized by interactions of the c-terminal sequence with the trimeric neck domain 21 26 . interestingly the three crds show a deviation from threefold asymmetry suggesting some flexibility of the crds in relation to the neck. thus the dependence of the binding of pi on the c-terminal sequence could reflect conformational effects rather than the direct participation of this sequence in ligand interactions. the collagen domain length of sp-d is highly conserved and lacks interruptions in the repeating gly-x-y sequence in which x and y are different amino acids . as for other collagenous proteins this domain is enriched in imino acids and contains hydroxyproline. unlike sp-a sp-d also contains hydroxylysine. although the collagen domain of rat human bovine and mouse sp-d lacks cysteine residues cdna sequencing has identified a codon for cysteine within the collagen domain of pig sp-d 27 this suggests the possibility of alternative patterns of chain association and oligomeric assembly for pig sp-d. the first translated exon of sp-d contains a highly conserved and unusually hydrophilic gly-x-y sequence that shows little homology with the remainder of the collagen sequence. the functional significance of this region is unknown. however it has been suggested that this region contributes to oligomer assembly or mediates interactions with cellular receptors. the collagen domain determines the maximal spatial separation of trimeric c-terminal lectin domains within sp-d molecules but might also contribute to normal oligomeric assembly and secretion. for example deletion of the entire collagen domain of rat sp-d results in the secretion of trimers rather than dodecamers 28 . in addition 2 2-dipyridyl an inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylation that interferes with the formation of a stable collagen helix causes the intracellular accumulation of 43 kda monomers and dimers 29 . in any case the complete conservation of the number of gly-x-y triplets suggests that the spatial separation of trimeric crds is critical for normal sp-d function. the n-terminal peptide of the mature protein contains two conserved cysteine residues at positions 15 and 20. these residues participate in interchain disulfide crosslinks that stabilize the trimer as well as the n-terminal association of four or more trimeric subunits. stable oligomerization of trimeric subunits permits cooperative or bridging interactions between spatially separated binding sites on the same surface or on different particles. the process of forming interchain disulfide bonds is complex and appropriate crosslinking of the n-terminal domains might be rate limiting for secretion 30 . subcellular fractionation studies suggest that interchain bonds form initially between the three chains of a trimeric subunit. subsequent rearrangements within the rough endoplasmic reticulum might allow the covalent crosslinking of a single chain from one subunit and two crosslinked chains of another with the associated elimination of free thiol groups. mutant proteins that contain unpaired n-terminal cysteine residues are not secreted. however it is unclear whether this results from abnormalities in disulfide bonding itself or the failure to stabilize the required n-terminal conformation. the collagen domain contains hydroxylysyl-derived glycosides and a single n-linked oligosaccharide. in most species human rat mouse and cow the site of n-linked glycosylation is located near the n-terminal end of the collagenous domain. recently it was shown that pig sp-d has an additional potential site of n-linked glycosylation within the crd 27 . although rat and human lung lavage sp-d seem to be sialylated as suggested by charge heterogeneity and cleavage with highly purified neuraminidase preparations of human amniotic fluid and bovine lavage sp-d recovered from amniotic fluid showed predominantly complex type biantennary structures and no sialic acid 31 . a variant form of sp-d 50 kda has been identified in lavage from a subset of human lavage samples this protein shows o-linked glycosylation of threonyl residues within the n-terminal peptide domain 32 . at present the functional significance of these sugars is not known. the presence of o-linked glycosylation within the n-terminal domain might be predicted to interfere with normal dodecamer assembly. in this regard the o-glycosylated 50 kda form of human sp-d is recovered as trimeric subunits or smaller species. as for many glycoproteins the functional role of the attached carbohydrate is unknown. mutational analysis has shown that the n-linked sugar on rat sp-d is not required for secretion for dodecamer formation or for interactions with a variety of microorganisms 29 33 . consistent with its designation as a mannose-type' c-type lectin sp-d preferentially binds to simple and complex saccharides containing mannose glucose or inositol 34 35 . sp-d also interacts with specific constituents of pulmonary surfactant including pi 36 37 38 and glucosylceramide 39 . binding to glucosylceramide involves interactions of the carbohydrate-binding sequences of the crd with the glucosyl moiety. however the interaction of sp-d with pi involves interactions with the lipid as well as crd-dependent interactions with the inositol moiety 24 40 . microorganisms are surfaced with a diverse and complex array of polysaccharides and glycoconjugates and most classes of microorganism contain one or more sugars recognized by sp-d. however the outcome of this interaction depends on the specific organism and can be modified by the conditions of microbial growth. the potential consequences of this interaction include the following varying degrees of lectin-dependent aggregation namely microbial agglutination enhanced binding of microorganisms or microbial aggregates to their receptors' on host cells phagocyte activation and opsonic enhancement of phagocytosis and killing potentially involving one or more cellular receptors for sp-d. sp-d binds to purified lipopolysaccharide lps isolated from a variety of gram-negative organisms 35 41 . in addition lps is the major cell wall component that is labeled on lectin blotting of outer membranes isolated from escherichia coli 41 . the latter interactions involve the recognition of the core oligosaccharide domain which contains glucose and heptose 41 . sp-d interacts preferentially with purified lps molecules characterized by short or absent o-antigens and preferentially agglutinates bacterial strains expressing a predominance of rough o-antigen-deficient lps 41 44 . although the core oligosaccharide domain of lps constitutes the major ligand for sp-d on at least some gram-negative bacteria the mechanism of interaction with this group of microorganisms is probably heterogeneous. sp-d binds to some smooth unencapsulated strains of gram-negative bacteria by immunofluorescence. the mechanism is uncertain the quantity or quality of binding differs from that observed for rough strains and does not necessarily result in agglutination. lps molecules on the surfaces of bacteria show heterogeneity in the extent of maturation so it is possible that this interaction is mediated by a subpopulation of lps with deficient o-antigens and that the density of binding sites is too low for high-affinity binding. the recognition of the surface glycoconjugates on gram-negative bacteria by sp-d depends not only on the expression of lectin-specific residues by a given strain or species but also on the accessibility of these residues 1 45 . for example sp-d binds inefficiently to the core region of lps of encapsulated klebsiella but efficiently agglutinates the corresponding unencapsulated phase variants. interactions of sp-d with the core oligosaccharides of gram-negative organisms are also influenced by the number of repeating saccharide units associated with the terminal o-antigen of the lps 41 44 . other potential ligands include the o-antigen domain of lps certain capsular polysaccharides and membrane-associated glycoproteins. in this regard sp-d can bind to di-mannose containing o-antigens expressed by a subset of klebsiella serotypes i ofek h sahly and ec crouch unpublished data . although other c-type lectins specifically sp-a and the mannose receptor can interact with specific capsular polysaccharides 46 a specific interaction of sp-d with capsular glycoconjugates or exopolysaccharides has not been described. the mechanism of interaction with gram-positive organisms has not been elucidated. lipoteichoic acids which are the major glycolipids associated with the gram-positive cell wall do not detectably compete with lps for binding to sp-d i ofek a mesika m kalina y keisari d chang d mcgregor and ec crouch manuscript submitted . in preliminary studies we observed that binding was competed only partly with maltose and or edta raising the possibility that binding might be more complex than for some gram-negative organisms. recently sp-d was shown to interact with the terminal mannosyl-oligosaccharides of lipoarabinomannan from mycobacterium tuberculosis 43 . the consequences of binding with regard to host cell function are not always predictable. opsonization of mucoid strains of p. aeruginosa with rat sp-d enhanced the internalization by alveolar macrophages and these experiments further suggested the involvement of a cellular receptor for sp-d 47 . interestingly the organisms were not detectably aggregated by sp-d. similarly human sp-d enhanced the internalization and killing of unencapsulated phase variants of klebsiella pneumoniae 45 i ofek a mesika m kalina y keisari d chang d mcgregor and ec crouch manuscript submitted . however unlike the situation reported for p. aeruginosa the organisms showed varying degrees of aggregation some of the largest aggregates were identified in association with the macrophage membrane but were not internalized. in other studies human proteinosis sp-d did not enhance the internalization of e. coli j5 a rough laboratory strain by rat alveolar macrophages despite efficient bacterial agglutination 48 . in addition sp-d inhibited the adherence of mycobacterium tuberculosis to monocyte-derived macrophages despite efficient microbial aggregation 43 . rat and human sp-d enhanced the binding and uptake of e. coli k12 streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus by human neutrophils 42 . however similar effects were observed when the neutrophils were preincubated with sp-d and there was only a slight enhancement of uptake when bacteria were incubated with human sp-d and washed before their addition to neutrophils. notably the extent of binding and internalization was dependent on the extent of multimerization with human sp-d multimers demonstrating the highest potency. differences in cell type the extent of sp-d multimerization or differences in size or organization of bacterial aggregates could account for some of the apparent inconsistencies. although lps mediates the binding of sp-d to at least some gram-negative bacteria sp-d can also bind to specific forms of soluble lps particularly rough' or o-antigen-deficient forms 35 41 44 . because soluble lps can modulate a variety of cellular responses and is the key mediator of gram-negative sepsis such interactions could have considerable biological significance. several observations suggest a potential protective role of sp-d in the host response to endotoxin. for example sp-d can bind to intratracheally instilled lps in rats and the resulting complexes are rapidly internalized into lysosomal compartments in alveolar macrophages 49 . in addition as discussed below preliminary studies suggest that transgenic mice deficient in sp-d develop more intense inflammation in response to intratracheal challenge with lps 50 . of particular interest is the recent observation that sp-d can bind directly to oligosaccharides on scd14 a soluble form of one component of the lps receptor complex and modify its interactions with lps 51 . although sp-a can bind to lps the interaction is mechanistically different and involves interactions with the lipid a domain and perhaps saccharides associated with certain o-antigens. human sp-a but not sp-d increases the uptake and deacylation of tritiated e. coli lps by isolated alveolar macrophages 52 but the biological significance of this finding is uncertain. sp-d binds in a crd-dependent manner to gpa gp-140 a heavily mannosylated glycoprotein associated with the trophozoites and cysts of pneumocystis carinii 53 . sp-d can also bind to cell wall β-glucans 54 . sp-d binding enhances the association of pneumocystis carinii with rat alveolar macrophages however the bound organisms are not efficiently internalized or killed in vitro 53 . sp-d interacts with most of the clinically important fungal pathogens including cryptococcus neoformans aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans 55 56 57 . we have also observed binding to clinical isolates of histoplasma capsulatum and blastomyces dermatitidis sf kuan s moser and e crouch unpublished data . in all cases reported so far binding is accompanied by agglutination. in particular sp-d efficiently agglutinates aspergillus fumigatus conidia 55 and candida albicans 57 . although sp-d also shows crd-dependent agglutination of unencapsulated forms of cryptococcus neoformans no significant binding to encapsulated organisms was observed 56 . there is still relatively little information on the mechanism of sp-d binding to fungi. however sp-d shows crd-dependent binding to the n-linked sugars of specific cell wall glycoproteins including major glycoprotein allergens of aspergillus fumigatus 55 . because sp-d shows lectin-dependent binding to wild-type saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as to mutants with low levels of mannosylphosphate in the cell wall the interactions probably do not involve n-linked phosphomannan sugars 58 . the observation that sp-d interacts with β-glucans on the surface of pneumocystis 54 suggests that these glycoconjugates which are abundant in the cell walls of true fungi could serve as ligands for sp-d. as for bacteria the effects of sp-d binding on the phagocytic response to fungi are somewhat controversial. human sp-d enhances the oxidative response to and internalization and killing of aspergillus fumigatus conidia by human alveolar macrophages and blood neutrophils 59 . however other investigators observed binding of rat and human sp-d to conidia but found no enhancement of internalization by rat alveolar macrophages 60 . furthermore rat sp-d inhibits the phagocytosis of candida albicans by these cells 57 . in the latter study the authors suggested that fungal aggregation inhibits phagocytosis. interestingly sp-d binding directly inhibited fungal growth and decreased the outgrowth of pseudohyphae the invasive form of the fungus in the absence of phagocytic cells 57 . it is possible that these effects are also secondary to agglutination possibly as result of nutrient deprivation. purified rat and human sp-d inhibit the infectivity and hemagglutination activity of influenza a virus iav in vitro 61 . this activity is calcium-dependent inhibited by carbohydrate ligands and involves the binding of sp-d to high-mannose oligosaccharides associated with the ha1domain of the hemagglutinin ha molecule. because the high-mannose oligosaccharide on the ha1 domain over-lies the sialic acid-binding pocket the cell attachment site of the ha binding can interfere sterically with ha activity and cellular attachment. sp-d also binds to the neuraminidase of iav and inhibits neuraminidase enzyme activity 62 . sp-d induces massive aggregation of iav particles 18 33 61 63 . viral aggregation is calcium-dependent inhibited by competing sugars and directly correlated with the multimerization state of sp-d. highly multimerized preparations of sp-d are significantly more potent than dodecamers. in particular minimal agglutination is induced with trimeric crds. massive agglutination of organisms could contribute to lung host defense by promoting airway mucociliary clearance but it might also influence the internalization by phagocytic cells. sp-d enhances the binding and uptake of iav by neutrophils 33 61 63 and these effects are highly dependent on the extent of multimerization of sp-d and its ability to agglutinate the viral particles 18 30 33 . the enhancement of viral binding and uptake is accompanied by attachment of large aggregates of virus to the neutrophil and the binding of iav or sp-d-iav aggregates is abrogated by pretreatment of the phagocyte with neuraminidase 63 . thus viral internalization involves enhanced binding of the virus to sialylated glycoconjugate ligands on the neutrophil surface. sp-d also potentiates iav-induced hydrogen peroxide responses in neutrophils and protects neutrophils from iav-induced inhibition of respiratory burst responses. interestingly sp-d does not increase the uptake of iav by rat alveolar macrophages 64 . thus there might be cell type specific effects of sp-d on phagocytic cells. notably human bronchoalveolar lavage bal contains sufficient concentrations of sp-d to inhibit iav ha activity in vitro and depletion of sp-d from bal reduces its ha inhibitory activity 61 . sp-d can also interact with other respiratory viruses. for example natural sp-d and a recombinant trimeric sp-d bind to the rous sarcoma virus g protein in vitro and inhibit viral infectivity in vivo 65 . these studies suggest that crd-dependent binding but not aggregation is required to mediate the antiviral effect. in addition bovine sp-d inhibits the infectivity of rotaviruses through calcium-dependent mannose-inhibitable attachment to the major viral envelope glycoprotein 66 . as indicated above the ability of sp-d to elicit the chemotaxis of neutrophilic and monocytic cells depends on the lectin activity of sp-d 68 . in addition kuan and coworkers reported that extracting formaldehyde-fixed alveolar macrophages with detergents largely eliminates the binding of purified sp-d suggesting a membrane-associated ligand or glycolipid receptor 73 . dong and wright have extended these findings and suggest that pi can contribute to sp-d binding by alveolar macrophages 74 . it is of interest that sp-d can bind to recombinant scd14 through interactions with n-linked oligosaccharides 51 . given that the membrane-associated form of cd14 is widely expressed on host cells it is possible that cd14 can serve as a binding site on macrophages and other cell types. the phagocytic uptake of certain bacteria by neutrophils is also inhibited by calcium chelation or competing sugars 42 however this could result from the inhibition of microbial agglutination rather than lectin-dependent interactions with the phagocyte. wang et al suggested that sp-d can bind to lymphocytic cells by a lectin-dependent mechanism 75 . in this regard it is interesting to note that glucosylceramide a ligand for sp-d in vitro is one of the most abundant neutral glycolipids expressed by lymphoid cells. reid and co-workers were the first to present evidence for lectin-independent binding 76 . these and other studies suggested that binding does not involve known c1q or collectin receptors. the only putative receptor protein gp-340 is a widely expressed member of the scavenger receptor superfamily 77 78 . it binds to the crd of sp-d in a calcium-dependent manner that does not require the lectin activity of sp-d. although the protein has been immunolocalized to alveolar macrophage membranes and distributes together with sp-d in many different human tissues 10 77 it has not yet been shown to mediate the binding of sp-d to these cells or to participate in signal transduction events. the cdnas isolated from lung have not shown a membrane-spanning region 77 and the protein is abundant as a soluble component in bal. given that gp-340 is a highly multimerized protein that contains numerous potential ligand binding domains fig. 1b it is possible that the protein cooperates with sp-d in the neutralization or clearance of certain ligands rather than specifically mediating the interactions of sp-d with host cells. wright and co-workers have demonstrated the binding of sp-d to isolated type ii pneumocytes. the mechanism seems distinct from the binding to macrophages 79 . the binding was dependent on concentration time and temperature and required calcium it was not sensitive to protease treatment or to pi-phospholipase c. although the internalized sp-d was degraded or recycled to lamellar bodies sp-d binding did not alter the uptake of surfactant lipids. sp-d has demonstrated comparatively few direct effects on the metabolism of host cells at least in situations where self-aggregation and endotoxin contamination have been excluded. one possible explanation is that modulation of cellular function requires the prior interaction of sp-d with a ligand. this would have numerous potential physiological advantages because the presence of active' protein might be restricted to sites of microbial or antigenic deposition. the binding of complex multivalent particulate antigens to two or more crds could markedly alter the conformation of sp-d molecules with respect to the spatial orientation of the arms in relation to the n-terminal crosslinking domain and or with respect to the spatial orientation of the crds within a given trimeric subunit. thus the charging' of sp-d with a particulate ligand could lead to local or distant conformational changes that expose cryptic' binding sites for cellular receptors. there is some preliminary evidence consistent with the notion that the interaction of sp-d with a ligand alters its capacity to activate host cells. for example ofek et al have examined the effects of sp-d lps and lps-coated latex beads on the production of nitric oxide by alveolar macrophage-like cells i ofek a mesika m kalina y keisari d chang d mcgregor and ec crouch manuscript submitted . under conditions in which sp-d lps latex beads or latex beads coated with sp-d or lps were no more than minimally stimulatory the opsonization of lps-coated latex beads with sp-d resulted in a marked increase in no production i ofek a mesika m kalina y keisari d chang d mcgregor and ec crouch manuscript submitted . although these effects can be abrogated with competing sugars it is unclear whether the inhibitory effect of competing sugars involves the disruption of the interaction of sp-d with the ligand the host cell or both. all the effects could be secondary to altered presentation of the aggregated particles to receptors for the particulate ligand on the host cell. thus it is unclear whether one needs to invoke the participation of an sp-d receptor for many of its functions. it is well established that the binding of sp-d to iav particles leads to aggregation-dependent enhancement of viral binding to neutrophils with an increased oxidative response 45 . these effects involve the natural receptors for the virus on the neutrophil. significantly the effects on neutrophil function are blocked by enzymic destruction of the sialic acid-binding sites for the ha on the neutrophil membrane 63 suggesting that the effects of sp-d do not require cellular recognition of the bound protein. aggregation might also be important for mediating the interactions of neutrophils with some bacteria 42 . particle aggregation might be particularly important for other aspects of sp-d function. the relatively large spatial separation of crds seems highly suited to bridging interactions between particles with resultant aggregation as demonstrated by experiments with iav. particle aggregation could similarly contribute to the metabolism of certain subfractions of surfactant lipid. for example poulain et al have shown that sp-d can mediate the formation of characteristic tubular configurations of lipid mixtures containing pi 80 . similar structures have been identified in association with type ii cells in culture and in alveolar proteinosis lavage. in addition persson et al demonstrated the aggregation of pi-containing liposomes 36 . sp-d can be isolated in different multimeric forms from proteinosis lavage 32 and are produced by chinese hamster ovary k1 cells transfected with human sp-d cdna 18 . as described previously the effects of sp-d on the neutrophil response to influenza virus are highly dependent on the ability of sp-d to agglutinate the viral particles and the agglutination activity is directly correlated with the extent of multimerization. trimers can bind to the virus but have little capacity to modulate neutrophil interactions. by contrast highly multimerized proteins show greater activity than dodecamers 81 . given these observations factors that favor enhanced oligomerization or lead to the accumulation of trimeric subunits promote might influence sp-d function. for example the liberation of active trimers by a hypothetical microbial protease could lead to the accumulation of molecules that might inhibit the aggregation-dependent activities of sp-d. in contrast recombinant trimeric crds can stimulate chemotaxis 67 and decrease viral infectivity 65 . although higher-order oligomers of sp-d can self-aggregate and precipitate in the presence of calcium in vitro the functional consequences are not known. the lectin activity of sp-a is decreased after the nitric oxide-dependent nitration of tyrosine residues 82 and nitration decreases the ability of sp-a to enhance the adherence of pneumocystis to alveolar macrophages 83 . however similar findings have not yet been reported for sp-d. conditions of mildly acidic ph as might be found in endocytic compartments are predicted to disrupt the lectin-dependent activities of sp-d 34 . proteolytic degradation remains an important possibility. however sp-d is highly resistant to degradation by a wide variety of neutral proteases in vitro and degradation products have not yet been shown to accumulate under pathological conditions in vivo. glucose concentrations at levels encountered in diabetes can interfere with sp-d's ability to interact with specific strains of iav or other microorganisms in vitro 84 . many microorganisms release cell wall polysaccharides or glycoconjugates which might interfere with the binding of collectins to the same or other organisms. in this regard sp-d recovered from rats after the instillation of lps into the airway shows decreased lectin activity which is attributed to occupancy of the crd with lps 49 . it seems reasonable to speculate that some organisms might compete with other organisms for binding to sp-d. such a situation could conceivably predispose to secondary infections. lastly the potential inhibitory effects of competing saccharide ligands presents important methodological considerations for experiments using carbohydrate-containing cell culture medium or buffers. it is difficult to predict the functions of sp-d within the airspace. other lectins with overlapping specificity are also present. although the levels of mannose-binding lectin are probably low in the absence of increased vascular permeability sp-a and the macrophage mannose receptor could conceivably interact with the same ligands in the distal airways and alveoli. such interactions could lead to antagonistic or cooperative effects. furthermore we have little knowledge regarding the microanatomic distribution of these molecules in specific circumstances in vivo. although most sp-a is probably associated with the insoluble phase of the alveolar lining material and the macrophage mannose receptor is membrane-associated the distribution might be altered in the setting of lung injury. models of sp-d deficiency show no detectable anatomical or physiological abnormalities at birth. however the animals gradually develop a patchy subpleural alveolar lipidosis with associated type ii cell hypertrophy the accumulation of enlarged and foamy macrophages and an apparent expansion of peribronchial lymphoid tissue 85 86 . interestingly the mice eventually develop distal-acinar emphysema and areas of subpleural fibrosis which could reflect a continuing inflammatory reaction associated with abnormal oxidant metabolism and metalloproteinase activity 87 . by contrast sp-a-deficient mice - - show essentially normal respiratory function and surfactant lipid metabolism 88 89 but numerous apparent host defense abnormalities 90 . the capacity of sp-d to bind to specific strains of influenza a in vitro is highly correlated with the capacity of the virus to proliferate in mice in vivo 62 . specifically strains with more oligosaccharide attachments on the ha are preferentially neutralized by sp-d in vitro and show decreased proliferation in mice. because the administration of mannan together with the virus increased the replication of iav in the lung the involvement of a mannose-type c-type lectin was implicated. sp-d-sensitive iav strains also replicate to higher titers in the lungs of diabetic mice than in nondiabetic controls 84 . replication of the virus is positively correlated with blood glucose level and decreases in response to insulin treatment. significantly blood glucose levels comparable to those measured in the diabetic mice were sufficient to inhibit the interaction of sp-d with these viral strains in vitro. pr-8 a strain that does not interact with sp-d but does interact with sp-a replicated to the same extent in diabetic and control mice. sp-d levels increase in association with certain infections. for example sp-d levels but not the levels of serum mannose-binding lectin increase markedly after iav infection 62 . impressive increases in sp-d have also been observed in murine models of pneumocystis carinii 91 and p. aeruginosa infection 92 . sp-d-deficient mice have not yet been extensively characterized with respect to host defense function. however they show decreased viral clearance and enhanced inflammation after challenge with respiratory syncytial virus 93 and iav am levine personal communication . in addition they show increased inflammation increased oxidant production and decreased macrophage phagocytosis in response to intratracheally instilled group b streptococcus and haemophilus influenzae am levine personal communication . although the overexpression of wild-type sp-d in type ii pneumocytes with the sp-d-deficient mice can prevent the lipidosis and inflammatory changes 94 the ability of overexpressed wild-type sp-d or exogenous sp-d to ameliorate these abnormalities has not yet been described. the coexisting pulmonary abnormalities also complicate the interpretation of challenge models. for example macrophage activation might enhance killing and offset any decrease that results more directly from sp-d deficiency. sp-d deficiency modifies the host response to instilled lps with decreased lung injury and inflammatory cell recruitment 50 . molecules that can bind to potential antigens and deliver them to macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells might contribute to the development of acquired immunity. in this regard a few published observations suggest possible roles in the development of humoral and or cellular immunity in response to microorganisms or complex organic antigens. for example sp-d can decrease interleukin-2-dependent t-lymphocyte proliferation 95 . interestingly single-arm mutants were at least as potent as intact dodecamers in mediating this effect. sp-d also binds to oligosaccharides associated with dust mite allergen 96 and can inhibit the binding of specific ige to these allergens possibly through direct crd-dependent binding to lymphocytes 96 . thus alterations in the level of sp-d or the state of oligomerization might influence the development of immunological responses and contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma and other hypersensitivity disorders. there are other potential interplays between humoral immunity and collectins with regard to antimicrobial host defense. for example increased glycosylation of iav coat proteins an adaptation that is believed to help the virus to evade antibody-mediated neutralization is associated with increased reactivity with sp-d and other collectins 62 . thus the relative potential importance of antibody and col-lectin-mediated host defenses might be influenced by subtle variations in the structure of the microbial surface. there is little recent information on the developmental regulation of sp-d expression. in general sp-d increases rapidly late in gestation 97 98 99 100 . the production of sp-d increases during the culture of fetal lung explants and expression can be increased with glucocorticoids 98 100 101 . the exposure of fetal rats to glucocorticoids in vivo leads to precocious expression with increased numbers of sp-d-expressing cells and increased cellular levels of sp-d message 98 101 102 . although sp-d is produced constitutively within the lung protein accumulation and gene expression are inducible and increases in sp-d expression have been observed in a number of disease states or models tables 4 and 5 . in general the synthesis and secretion of sp-d increase in association with lung injury and activation of the respiratory epithelium 1 . for example levels of sp-d mrna and sp-d accumulation are increased within 24-72h after intratracheal instillation of lps 103 and sp-d expression by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells increases after exposure of rats to 95 o2 for 12 h 104 . keratinocyte growth factor kgf increases sp-d expression and protein production in association with pneumocyte hyperplasia and after injury caused by bleomycin 105 . in addition the levels of sp-d can increase markedly in response to the overexpression of certain cytokines such as interleukin-4 or in response to microbial challenge 91 92 . studies of the upstream regulatory region of the sp-d gene have demonstrated increased promoter activity in the presence of glucocorticoids which is consistent with the findings in vivo and in lung organ culture 106 . however no functional glucocorticoid response elements have been identified and the effects of dexamethasone seem to be secondary and involve the effects of other transregulatory molecules. the activity of the human sp-d promoter is dependent on a conserved activator protein-1 ap-1 element -109 that binds to members of the fos and jun families of transcriptional factors 107 . in addition the promoter contains multiple functional binding sites for ccaat-enhancer-binding protein c ebp transcription factors. mutagenesis experiments suggest that these are required for basal and stimulated promoter activity and promoter activity is markedly increased in h441 cells after co-transfection with c ebpβ cdna yc he and e crouch unpublished data . the importance of the conserved ap-1 element and the presence of multiple binding sites for c ebp transcription factors is consistent with the observed modulation of sp-d expression in the setting of tissue injury. sp-d promoter activity is not dependent on the binding of thyroid transcription factor 1 ttf-1 107 . however promoter activity is dependent on two interacting forkhead binding sites upstream and downstream of the ap-1 element these sites bind to hepatic nuclear factor-3α and apparently other forkhead box proteins in h441 lung adenocarcinoma nuclear extracts 107 . initial comparison of genomic and cdna sequence suggested the existence of genetic polymorphisms in the sp-d coding sequence including one in the n-terminal propeptide domain thr11 compared with met11 in the mature protein and three additional differences within the collagen domain at positions 102 160 and 186 108 . the latter substitutions are conservative to the extent that they are not expected to disrupt the collagen helix. floros and co-workers have recently confirmed the existence of polymorphisms at positions 11 and 160 of the mature protein 109 . the potential biological significance if any is not known. interestingly the 50 kda variant of sp-d showed o-linked glycosylation of thr11 32 suggesting that this polymorphism might be associated with altered glycosylation. interestingly the 50 kda variant was recovered as trimeric subunits raising the possibility that differences in the glycosylation of residue 11 which is immediately n-terminal to cys15 could influence multimerization and the capacity of sp-d to participate in bridging interactions. there is increasing evidence that sp-d interacts specifically with a wide variety of respiratory pathogens modulates the leukocyte response to these organisms and participates in aspects of pulmonary immune and inflammatory regulation table 6 . sp-d can influence the activity of phagocytes through crd-dependent and crd-independent interactions. at least some of the effects of sp-d result from aggregation with enhanced binding of the agglutinated ligand to their natural receptors'. although the lung is the major site of sp-d expression it is likely that the protein has more generalized roles in host defense and the acute response to infection and tissue injury.\"}}\n",

muscle tone and inflammatory mediator that may play a key role in diseases of the airways pulmonary circulation and inflammatory lung diseases both acute and chronic. this review will focus on the biology of et-1 and its role in lung disease.', 'body': \"et-1 et-2 and et-3 are members of a peptide family that has been the subject of much interest in the past decade. our laboratory and that of highsmith identified this peptide vasoconstrictor secreted from endothelial cells 1 2 3 that was subsequently isolated sequenced cloned and named by yanagisawa in 1988 4 . the many diverse and overlapping functions of these peptides have since implicated endothelins in both homeostatic mechanisms as well as diseases of the lungs. this review will focus on the role of endothelins particularly et-1 emphasizing the need to better understand endothelin biology and function in a wide variety of disorders including diseases of the airways and pulmonary vasculature lung tumors the acute respiratory distress syndrome and fibrotic diseases table 1 . the endothelins are a family of 21 amino acid peptides of which there are three distinct isoforms et-1 et-2 and et-3 . the isoforms et-2 and et-3 differ from et-1 by two and six amino acids respectively and share significant homology especially at the carboxy terminus with sarafotoxins a-e fig. 1 . endothelin-1 is the most abundant isoform and has been best characterized. the lung has the highest levels of et-1 secreted by endothelium smooth muscle airway epithelium and a variety of other cells table 2 . et-1 also circulates in the plasma. in the normal lung et-1 mainly localizes to vascular endothelium airway and vascular smooth muscle cells and to a lesser degree the epithelium. et-2 has similar biologic functions as et-1 and is found in the myocardium kidney and placental tissues. et-3 also circulates in plasma and is found in the central nervous system gastrointestinal tract lung and kidney although the cellular source is not clear. the gene for et-1 is located on chromosome 6 that for et-2 on chromosome 1 and the gene for et-3 on chromosome 20 5 . all three endothelins are synthesized as preprohormones and post-translationally processed to active peptides. et-1 processing has been best characterized and begins with the 212 amino acid peptide preproet-1 which is then proteolytically cleaved by endopeptidases to big et-1 proet-1 . the 39 amino acid proet-1 has 1 of the biologic activity of et-1 and is cleaved by the metalloendoprotease endothelin converting enzyme ece resulting in the 21 amino acid protein with potent biologic functions 6 7 fig. 1 . ece is found in many cell types in the lung including endothelium epithelium and alveolar macrophages 8 . et-1 is not stored in the cell 9 10 but is processed and transported through the cell in vesicles resulting in directional secretion 80 of et-1 toward the interstitium and smooth muscle and away from the luminal surface of the airway or vessel 11 12 13 . directional secretion allows et-1 to act in a paracrine or autocrine manner whereas secretion into the circulation allows et-1 to act as a hormone. there are currently two distinct human endothelin receptors known endothelin a eta and endothelin b etb receptors which are members of the seven transmembrane g protein-coupled rhodopsin superfamily 14 15 . the eta and etb receptor genes are located on chromosomes 4 and 13 respectively. eta has a higher affinity for et-1 and et-2 than et-3 but all three have equal affinity for etb receptors. a third receptor subtype endothelin c with high affinity for et-3 has been isolated and cloned from xenopus laevis 16 . eta receptors in normal lung are found in greatest abundance on vascular and airway smooth muscle whereas etb receptors are most often found on the endothelium. clearance of et-1 from the circulation is mediated by the etb receptor primarily in the lung but also in the kidney and liver 17 . activation of both eta and etb receptors on smooth muscle cells leads to vasoconstriction whereas etb receptor activation leads to bronchoconstriction. activation of etb receptors located on endothelial cells leads to vasodilation by increasing nitric oxide no production. the mitogenic and inflammatory modulator functions of et-1 are primarily mediated by eta receptor activity. binding of the ligand to its receptor results in coupling of cell-specific g proteins that activate or inhibit adenylate cyclase stimulate phosphatidyl-inositol-specific phosholipase open voltage gated calcium and potassium channels and so on. the varied effects of et-1 receptor activation thus depend on the g protein and signal transduction pathways active in the cell of interest 18 . a growing number of receptor antagonists exist with variable selectivity for one or both receptor subtypes. regulation of et-1 is at the level of transcription with stimuli including shear stress hypoxia cytokines il-2 il-1β tumor necrosis factor α ifn-β etc lipopolysaccharides and many growth factors transforming growth factor β platelet-derived growth factor epidermal growth factor etc inducing transcription of et-1 mrna and secretion of protein 18 . et-1 acting in an autocrine fashion may also increase et-1 expression 19 . et-1 expression is decreased by no 20 . some stimuli may additionally enhance preproet-1 mrna stability leading to increased and sustained et-1 expression. the number of eta and etb receptors is also cell specific and regulated by a variety of growth factors 18 . because et-1 and receptor expression is influenced by many diverse physical and biochemical mechanisms the role of et-1 in pathologic states has been difficult to define and these are addressed in subsequent parts of this article. in the airway et-1 is localized primarily to the bronchial smooth muscle with low expression in the epithelium. cellular subsets of the epithelium that secrete et-1 include mucous cells serous cells and clara cells 21 . et binding sites are found on bronchial smooth muscle alveolar septae endothelial cells and parasympathetic ganglia 22 23 . et-1 expression in the airways as previously noted is regulated by inflammatory mediators. eosinophilic airway inflammation as may be seen in severe asthma is associated with increased et-1 levels in the lung 24 . et-1 secretion may also act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion via the eta receptor leading to increased transepithelial potential difference and ciliary beat frequency and to exerting mitogenic effects on airway epithelium and smooth muscle cells 25 26 27 28 . all three endothelins cause bronchoconstriction in intact airways with et-1 being the most potent. denuded bronchi constrict equally to all three endothelins suggesting considerable modulation of et-1 effects by the epithelium 29 . the vast majority of et-1 binding sites on bronchial smooth muscle are etb receptors and bronchoconstriction in human bronchi is not inhibited by eta antagonists but augmented by etb receptor agonists 30 31 32 . since cultured airway epithelium secretes equal amounts of et-1 and et-3 which have equivalent affinity for the etb receptor bronchoconstriction could be mediated by both endothelins 33 . while et-1 stimulates release of multiple cytokines important in airway inflammation it does not enhance secretion of histamine or leukotrienes. et-1 does increase prostaglandin release 32 . inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase however has no effect on bronchoconstriction suggesting that despite the release of multiple mediators et-1 mediated bronchoconstriction is a direct effect of activation of the etb receptor 32 . eta mediated bronchoconstriction may also be important following etb receptor desensitization or denudation of the airway epithelium as may occur during airway inflammation and during the late sustained airway response to inhaled antigens 31 34 35 . interestingly heterozygous et-1 knockout mice with a 50 reduction in et-1 peptide have airway hyperresponsiveness but not remodeling suggesting the decrease in et-1 modulates bronchoconstriction activity by a functional mechanism possibly by decreasing basal no production 36 37 . asthma is also an inflammatory airway disease characterized by bronchoconstriction and hyperreactivity with influx of inflammatory cells mucus production edema and airway thickening. et-1 may have important roles in each of these processes. while et-1 causes immediate bronchoconstriction 38 it also increases bronchial reactivity to inhaled antigens 35 as well as influx of inflammatory cells 39 40 increased cytokine production 40 airway edema 41 and airway remodeling 28 42 43 . airway inflammation also leads to increased et-1 synthesis possibly perpetuating the inflammation and bronchoconstriction 44 . et-1 release from cultured peripheral mononuclear and bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatics is also increased 45 46 . inhibition of eta or combined eta and etb receptors additionally leads to decreased airway inflammation in antigen-challenged animals suggesting that the proinflammatory effects of et-1 in the airway are mediated by eta receptors 39 47 . children with asthma have increased circulating levels of et-1 48 . adult asthmatics have normal levels between attacks but during acute attacks have elevated serum et-1 levels that correlate inversely with airflow measurements and decrease with treatment 49 . bronchoalveolar lavage bal et-1 in asthmatics is similarly increased to concentrations that cause bronchoconstriction and inversely correlates with forced expiratory volume in 1 s fev1 29 50 51 . as in cultured epithelial cells et-1 and et-3 are found in equal amounts in bal fluid from asthmatics 33 52 . there is also a relative increase in etb versus eta receptor expression in asthmatic patients which may contribute to increased bronchoconstriction 53 . not all asthmatics however have increased et-1 as patients with nocturnal asthma have decreased bal et-1 levels 54 . treatment of acute asthma exacerbations with steroids beta-adrenergic agonists or phosphodiesterase inhibitors resulted in decreased bal et-1 52 55 . immunostaining and in situ hybridization for et-1 in biopsy specimens from asthmatics have shown an increase in et-1 in the bronchial epithelium that correlates with asthma symptoms 46 56 . cigarette smoking leads to increased circulating et-1 57 but patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the absence of pulmonary hypertension and hypoxemia do not have increased plasma et-1 58 59 60 . increases in urinary et-1 instead correlate with decreases in oxygenation possibly through hypoxic release of et-1 from the kidney 61 62 . smokers also have impaired et-1 mediated vasodilation that correlates with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and may contribute to pulmonary hypertension 63 64 . et-1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis by its ability to promote neutrophil chemotaxis adherence and activation 65 66 67 68 69 . sputum et-1 levels are increased in patients with cystic fibrosis 59 and sputum et-1 correlated with pseduomonas infection in noncystic fibrosis related bronchiectasis 70 . et-1 has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis obliterans bo which is characterized by injury to small conducting airways resulting in formation of proliferative collagen rich tissue obliterating airway architecture. bo is the leading cause of late mortality from lung transplantation and et-1 is increased in lung allografts 71 . the pro-inflammatory and mitogenic properties of et-1 in the airways has led to speculation that et-1 may be involved in formation of the lesion 28 . this is further supported by the increase in bal et-1 in lung allografts 72 73 . the in vivo gene transfer of et-1 to the airway epithelium using the hemagglutinating virus of japan in rats recently resulted in pathologic changes in the distal airways identical to those seen in human bo specimens 74 . these changes were not due to nonspecific effects of the hemagglutinating virus of japan itself but could be attributed to the presence of the et-1 gene which was localized to the airway epithelium hyperplastic lesions and alveolar cells. pulmonary hypertension is a rare and progressive disease characterized by increases in normally low pulmonary vascular tone pulmonary vascular remodeling and progressive right heart failure. et-1 has been implicated as a mediator in the changes seen in pulmonary hypertension. in the pulmonary vasculature et-1 is found primarily in endothelial cells and to a lesser extent in the vascular smooth muscle cells. the endothelium secretes et-1 primarily to the basolateral surface of the cell. et-1 secretion may be increased by a variety of stimuli including cytokines catecholamines and physical forces such as shear stress and decreased by no prostaglandins and oxidant stress 20 75 76 77 78 . hypoxia has been reported to increase have no effect or decrease et-1 release from endothelial cells 79 80 81 82 83 . activation of the receptors for et-1 in the pulmonary vasculature leads to both vasodilation and vasoconstriction and depends on both cell type and receptor. in the whole lung eta receptors are the most abundant and are localized to the medial layer of the arteries decreasing in intensity in the peripheral circulation 84 85 . etb receptors are also found in the media of the pulmonary vessels increasing in intensity in the distal circulation while intimal etb receptors are localized in the larger elastic arteries 85 . this distribution of receptors has important implications in understanding et-1 regulation of vascular tone. vascular et-1 receptors may be increased by several factors including angiotensin and hypoxia 80 85 86 87 . et-1 can act as both a vasodilator and vasoconstrictor in the pulmonary circulation. generation of no or opening of atp-sensitive potassium channels leading to hyperpolarization results in vasodilation mediated by etb receptors on pulmonary endothelium 88 89 . in hypertensive chronically hypoxic lungs with increased etb receptor expression augmented vasodilation is due to increased etb mediated no release that is inhibited by hypoxic ventilation while inhibition of no synthesis leads to increased et-1 mediated vasoconstriction 85 90 91 92 . both eta and etb receptors conversely acting on vascular smooth muscle mediate et-1 induced vasoconstriction. in the normal lung et-1 causes vasoconstriction primarily by activation of the eta receptors in the large conducting vessels of the lung 93 94 . in the smaller resistance vessels of the lung etb receptors in the media predominate and are responsible for the et-1 induced vasoconstriction 93 . interestingly preconstriction of the pulmonary circulation resulted in a shift from primarily eta mediated to etb mediated vasoconstriction 94 . the overall effect of et-1 on vascular tone depends on both the dose and on the pre-existing tone in the lung. et-1 administration during acute hypoxic vasoconstriction will result in transient pulmonary vasodilation 89 . this effect is dose dependent with lower doses leading to vasodilation while higher or repetitive doses cause vasoconstriction following an initial brief vasodilation 89 . the role of et-1 in the acute hypoxic vasoconstriction in the lung is not certain. eta receptor antagonism attenuates hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in several species 95 and et-1 may be implicated in the mechanism of acute hypoxic response by inhibition of k-atp channels 96 . several lines of evidence have suggested the importance of et-1 in chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. et-1 is increased in plasma and lungs of rats following exposure to hypoxia 80 97 . treatment with either eta or combined eta and etb receptor antagonists additionally attenuates the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension 98 99 . et-1 has also been implicated in the vascular remodeling associated with chronic hypoxia through its mitogenic effects on vascular smooth muscle cells 98 100 . et-1 has also been implicated in other animal models of pulmonary hypertension. et-1 is increased in fawn hooded rats that develop severe pulmonary hypertension when raised under conditions of mild hypoxia and in monocrotaline treated rats 101 102 . the increase in et-1 in both of these forms of pulmonary hypertension may be contributing to increases in vascular tone as well as in vascular remodeling 103 104 105 106 114 . interestingly transgenic mice overexpressing the human preproet-1 gene with modestly increased lung et-1 levels 35-50 do not develop pulmonary hypertension under normoxic conditions or an exaggerated response to chronic hypoxia 107 . human pulmonary hypertension is classified as primary or unexplained or secondary to other cardiopulmonary diseases or connective tissue diseases ie scleroderma . hallmarks of the disease include progressive increases in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular remodeling with thickening of the medial layer small pulmonary arterioles and formation of the complex plexiform lesion 108 . circulating et-1 is increased in humans with pulmonary hypertension either primary or due to other cardiopulmonary disease 109 . levels are highest in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. since the lung is the major source for clearance of et-1 from the circulation increased arterio-venous ratios as seen in primary pulmonary hypertension suggest either decreased clearance or increased production in the lung 17 109 . et-1 is also increased in lungs of patients with pulmonary hypertension with the greatest increase seen in the small resistance arteries and the plexiform lesions 110 and may correlate with pulmonary vascular resistance 111 . interestingly treatment with continuous infusion of prostacyclin resulted in clinical improvement and a decrease in the arterio-venous ratio of et-1 112 possibly by decreasing et-1 synthesis from endothelial cells 76 . studies using et-1 receptor antagonists in the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension are underway and may offer hope to patients with this disease by inhibiting this pluripotent peptide's effects on vascular tone and remodeling. several lines of evidence suggest the importance of et-1 in lung allograft survival and rejection. the peptide has been implicated as an important factor in ischemia-reperfusion injury at the time of transplant as well as in acute and chronic rejection of the allograft. circulating et-1 is increased in humans undergoing lung transplant immediately following perfusion of the allograft. plasma et-1 increased threefold within minutes remained high for 12 hours following transplantation and declined to near normal levels within 24 hours 113 . this increase in et-1 correlated with the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance occurring about 6 hours post-transplantation suggesting that the release of et-1 in the circulation may have mediated this event. et-1 in bal fluid from recipients of lung allografts is similarly increased several fold and remains elevated up to 2 years post-transplant 72 73 . in recipients of single lung transplants et-1 was increased 10-fold in bal fluid from the transplanted lung compared with the native lung suggesting that the increase in et-1 was due to the graft and not the underlying disease requiring transplant 72 . et-1 in bal fluid did not however correlate with episodes of infection or rejection. the cellular source of et-1 in lung allografts is unknown. the expression of et-1 in nontransplanted human lungs is low and found primarily in the vascular endothelium 114 . transbronchial biopsy specimens obtained either for surveillance or for clinical suspicion of infection or rejection following transplantation revealed the presence of et-1 in the airway epithelium and in alveolar macrophages 115 . et-1 was occasionally seen in lymphocytes but not in the endothelium or pneumocytes. et-1 localization was no different in surveillance specimens compared with infected or rejecting lungs or changed over time from transplantation. this study suggests that the source of the increased bal et-1 in transplanted lungs is due to the increased number of alveolar inflammatory cells and de novo expression in the airway epithelium. the biologic importance of the et-1 from inflammatory cells is supported by the observation that peripheral mononuclear cells from dogs with mild to moderate lung allograft rejection cause vasoconstriction in pulmonary arterial rings which is attenuated by the eta blocker bq123 116 . analysis of et-1 binding activity in failed transplanted human lungs suggested that et-1 binding activity was not different compared with normal lung in the lung parenchyma bronchial smooth muscle or perivascular infiltrates. et-1 binding was however decreased in small muscular arteries pulmonary arteries and bronchial arteries in the failed transplants suggesting a role for et-1 in impaired vasoregulation of transplanted lungs 117 . ischemia-reperfusion injury is the leading cause of early post-operative graft failure and death. in its severest manifestation increased pulmonary vascular resistance hypoxia and pulmonary edema lead to cor pulmonale and death 118 . et-1 has been implicated as a mediator of these events. the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance observed in human recipients of lung allografts follows an increase in circulating et-1 and falls with decreases in circulating et-1 113 . a similar pattern is seen in dogs subjected to allotransplantation 119 . conscious dogs with left pulmonary allografts demonstrate an increase in both resting pulmonary perfusion pressure and acute pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to hypoxia 120 . administration of eta selective or combined eta and etb receptor blockers did not change the resting tone. etb receptor mediated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction appeared however to be increased in allograft recipients. in another study administration of a mixed eta and etb receptor antagonist sb209670 to dogs before reperfusion of the allograft resulted in a marked increase in oxygenation decreases in pulmonary arterial pressures and improved survival compared with control animals 121 . in a model of ischemia reperfusion inhibitors of ece additionally attenuated the increase in circulating et-1 and the severity of lung injury 122 . et-1 receptor antagonists did not however completely eliminate the ischemia-reperfusion injury suggesting that changes in other vasoactive mediators such as an increase in thromboxane a decrease in prostaglandins or a decrease in no may also contribute to the increased pulmonary vascular resistance. administration of no donor fk409 to both donor and recipient dogs before lung transplantation reduced pulmonary arterial pressure lung edema and inflammation and improved survival. this suggests that reductions in no following transplantation may be partly responsible for early graft failure 123 . treatment with no donor was also associated with a decrease in plasma et-1 levels. acute rejection is manifested by diffuse infiltrates hypoxia and airflow limitation and may lead to respiratory insufficiency and death. bal et-1 was increased in dogs during episodes of acute rejection that decreased with immunosuppressive treatment 124 . acute episodes of rejection in humans however are not associated with further increases in bal et-1 72 . chronic rejection of allografts manifested as bo is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in long-term lung transplant survivors 71 . the etiology of bo following transplant is unclear but may be related to repeated episodes of acute rejection chronic low-grade rejection or organizing pneumonia 125 . as discussed earlier a chronic increase in et-1 as seen in lung allografts may contribute to bronchospasm and proliferative bronchiolitis obliterans due to the bronchoconstrictor and smooth muscle mitogenic effects of et-1 28 126 . this is further supported by the increase of bal et-1 in the transplanted lung which is susceptible to bo but not the native lung in recipients of single lung transplants 72 . the mitogenic effects of et-1 may play a role in the development of pulmonary malignancy as well as metastasis to the lung. many human tumor cell lines including prostate breast gastric ovary colon etc produce et-1. the importance of the et-1 may lie in its mitogenic effects on tumor growth and survival. this has been suggested by blockade of eta receptors resulting in a decrease in mitogenic effects of et-1 in a prostate cancer and colorectal cell lines 127 128 . et-1 receptors in tumor cells may also be altered with increases in the eta receptor and downregulation of etb receptors 129 . other tumors may have an increase in etb receptors however and blockade of etb results in a decrease in tumor growth 130 131 . tumor cells may as a result of this altered balance lose the ability to respond to regulatory signals from their environment. et-1 may additionally protect against fas-ligand mediated apoptosis 132 . et-1 has been detected using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in pulmonary adenocarcinomas and squamous cell tumors and to a lesser extent small cell and carcinoid tumors 133 . in situ hybridization also demonstrated a similar pattern of et-1 mrna expression in non-neuroendocrine tumors. et-1 receptors have also been found in a variety of pulmonary tumor cell lines. eta receptors were found in small cell tumors adenocarcinomas and large cell tumors while etb receptors were expressed primarily in adenocarcinomas and small cell tumors 134 . ece which converts big et-1 to et-1 the committed step in et-1 biosynthesis was also found in human lung tumors but not in adjacent normal lung 135 . these findings combined with the presence of et-1 in lung tumors suggest a possible autocrine loop that sustains and supports the growth of lung tumors. a recent study however suggested that while eta and ece-1 were detectable in lung tumors these genes were downregulated compared with normal bronchial epithelial cell lines 136 . it was proposed that the role of et-1 in lung tumors is not that of an autocrine factor but that of a paracrine growth factor to the stroma and vasculature surrounding the tumor allowing angiogenesis. tumor angiogenesis is necessary for continued growth of the tumor beyond the limits of oxygen diffusion. the growth of vessels into the tumor is also important to metastatic potential of the tumor. et-1 may play an important role in angiogenesis and tumor growth and survival through induction of vascular endothelial growth factor expression and sprouting of new vessels into the tumor and surrounding tissue 137 138 . et-1 binding activity was found in blood vessels and vascular stroma surrounding lung tumors at the time of resection most markedly surrounding squamous cell tumors 139 . et-1 production may be further augmented by the hypoxic environment found within large solid tumors 140 . since metastasis is dependent on neovascularization et-1 may also be an important mediator of this phenomenon. et-1 receptor antagonists may have a useful role in the treatment of neoplastic disease by inhibiting growth as well as metastatic potential of human tumors. experimental lung injury of many different types results in increased circulating et-1 bal et-1 and lung tissue et-1 18 . et-1 levels in humans are also increased in sepsis burns disseminated intravascular coagulation acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 . et-1 increases also correlate with a poorer outcome with multiple organ failure increased pulmonary arterial pressure increased airway pressure and decreased pio2 fio2 while clinical improvement correlates with decreased et-1 levels 144 145 147 . the arterio-venous ratio for et-1 is increased in patients with ards but it is not clear whether this is due to increased secretion of et-1 in the lungs or decreased clearance 142 144 . in patients who succumbed to ards there was also a marked increase in tissue et-1 immunostaining in vascular endothelium alveolar macrophages smooth muscle and airway epithelium compared with lungs of patients who died without ards. interestingly these same patients also had a decrease in immunostaining for both endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the lung 148 . ards is also characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells in the lung. since et-1 may act as an immune modulator an increase in et-1 may contribute to lung injury by inducing expression of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor and il-6 and il-8 149 . these cytokines may in turn stimulate the production of many inflammatory mediators leading to lung injury. et-1 additionally activated neutrophils and increased neutrophil migration and trapping in the lung 65 66 67 68 69 . another hallmark of ards is disruption and dysfunction of the pulmonary vascular endothelium leading to accumulation of lung water. the role of endothelin in formation of pulmonary edema is uncertain. infusion of et-1 raises pulmonary vascular pressure but it is uncertain whether et-1 by itself increased pulmonary protein or fluid transport in the lung 150 151 152 . et-1 may rather be acting synergistically with other mediators to lead to pulmonary edema 153 154 . pulmonary fibrosis is the final outcome for a variety of injurious processes involving the lung parenchyma. the final common pathway in response to injury to the alveolar wall involves recruitment of inflammatory cells release of inflammatory mediators and resolution. the reparative phase occasionally becomes disordered resulting in progressive fibrosis. et-1 in the lung may be important in the initial events in lung injury by activating neutrophils to aggregate and release elastase and oxygen radicals increasing neutrophil adherence activating mast cells and inducing cytokine production from monocytes 65 66 67 68 69 149 155 . among the many cytokines induced by et-1 that are important in mediating pulmonary fibrosis are transforming growth factor-β and tumor necrosis factor α 156 157 . et-1 is also profibrotic by stimulating fibroblast replication migration contraction and collagen synthesis and secretion while decreasing collagen degradation 158 159 160 161 162 . et-1 additionally enhances the conversion of fibroblasts into contractile myelofibroblasts 43 163 . et-1 also increases fibronectin production by bronchial epithelial cells 164 . finally et-1 has mitogenic effects on vascular and airway smooth muscle 126 28 . et-1 may thus play an important role in the initial injury and eventual fibrotic reparative process of many inflammatory events in the lung. several lines of evidence regarding the importance of et-1 in pulmonary fibrosis are available. plasma and bal et-1 levels are increased in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 50 165 . lung biopsies from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have additionally increased et-1 immunostaining in airway epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes which correlates with disease activity 166 . scleroderma is commonly associated with pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. plasma and bal et-1 is increased in these patients 160 167 168 but it is unclear whether the presence of either pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary fibrosis increases these levels further 167 . bal fluid from patients with scleroderma increased proliferation of cultured lung fibroblasts which was inhibited by eta receptor antagonist. this suggests that the et-1 in the airspace may be contributing significantly to the fibrotic response 160 . an increase in et-1 binding has also been reported in lung tissue from patients with scleroderma associated pulmonary fibrosis 169 . pulmonary inflammatory cells also appear to be primed for et-1 production because cultured alveolar macrophages from patients with scleroderma and lung involvement secrete increased amounts of et-1 in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide 170 . these observations collectively suggest that augmented et-1 release may contribute to and perpetuate the inflammatory process. bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in animals is associated with increased et-1 expression in alveolar macrophages and epithelium 171 . the increase in et-1 proceeds the development of pulmonary fibrosis. the use of et-1 receptor antagonists has produced mixed results in limiting the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis. a decrease in fibroblast replication and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins in vitro but not a decrease in lung collagen content in vivo has been shown using eta or combined eta and etb receptor antagonists after bleomycin 172 . another group did however observe a decrease in fibrotic area in lungs of rats following bleomycin that were treated with a mixed eta and etb receptor antagonist 173 . while et-1 seems to correlate with pulmonary fibrosis it remains uncertain whether the increase in et-1 is a cause or consequence of the lung disease. pulmonary fibrosis was recently reported in mice that constitutively overexpress human et-1 107 . these mice were known to develop progressive nephrosclerosis in the absence of systemic hypertension 174 . the transgene was localized throughout the lung with the strongest expression in the bronchial wall. in the lung the mice developed age-dependent accumulation of collagen and accumulation of cd4 lymphocytes in the perivascular space. this observation suggests that an increase in lung et-1 alone may play a causative role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis 107 175 . since its discovery 12 years ago much evidence has accumulated regarding the biologic activity and potential role of et-1 in a variety of diseases of the respiratory track. as compelling as much of this evidence is the causal relationship between et-1 activity and disease is not complete. the increasing use of ece and endothelin receptor antagonists in experimental and human respiratory disorders will help to clarify the role of this pluripotent peptide in health and disease. ards acute respiratory distress syndrome bal bronchoalveolar lavage bo

in lung disease endothelin-1 et-1 is a 21 amino acid peptide with diverse biological activity that has been implicated in numerous diseases. et-1 is a potent mitogen regulator of smooth muscle tone and inflammatory mediator that may play a key role in diseases of the airways pulmonary circulation and inflammatory lung diseases both acute and chronic. this review will focus on the biology of et-1 and its role in lung disease. et-1 et-2 and et-3 are members of a peptide family that has been the subject of much interest in the past decade. our laboratory and that of highsmith identified this peptide vasoconstrictor secreted from endothelial cells 1 2 3 that was subsequently isolated sequenced cloned and named by yanagisawa in 1988 4 . the many diverse and overlapping functions of these peptides have since implicated endothelins in both homeostatic mechanisms as well as diseases of the lungs. this review will focus on the role of endothelins particularly et-1 emphasizing the need to better understand endothelin biology and function in a wide variety of disorders including diseases of the airways and pulmonary vasculature lung tumors the acute respiratory distress syndrome and fibrotic diseases table 1 . the endothelins are a family of 21 amino acid peptides of which there are three distinct isoforms et-1 et-2 and et-3 . the isoforms et-2 and et-3 differ from et-1 by two and six amino acids respectively and share significant homology especially at the carboxy terminus with sarafotoxins a-e fig. 1 . endothelin-1 is the most abundant isoform and has been best characterized. the lung has the highest levels of et-1 secreted by endothelium smooth muscle airway epithelium and a variety of other cells table 2 . et-1 also circulates in the plasma. in the normal lung et-1 mainly localizes to vascular endothelium airway and vascular smooth muscle cells and to a lesser degree the epithelium. et-2 has similar biologic functions as et-1 and is found in the myocardium kidney and placental tissues. et-3 also circulates in plasma and is found in the central nervous system gastrointestinal tract lung and kidney although the cellular source is not clear. the gene for et-1 is located on chromosome 6 that for et-2 on chromosome 1 and the gene for et-3 on chromosome 20 5 . all three endothelins are synthesized as preprohormones and post-translationally processed to active peptides. et-1 processing has been best characterized and begins with the 212 amino acid peptide preproet-1 which is then proteolytically cleaved by endopeptidases to big et-1 proet-1 . the 39 amino acid proet-1 has 1 of the biologic activity of et-1 and is cleaved by the metalloendoprotease endothelin converting enzyme ece resulting in the 21 amino acid protein with potent biologic functions 6 7 fig. 1 . ece is found in many cell types in the lung including endothelium epithelium and alveolar macrophages 8 . et-1 is not stored in the cell 9 10 but is processed and transported through the cell in vesicles resulting in directional secretion 80 of et-1 toward the interstitium and smooth muscle and away from the luminal surface of the airway or vessel 11 12 13 . directional secretion allows et-1 to act in a paracrine or autocrine manner whereas secretion into the circulation allows et-1 to act as a hormone. there are currently two distinct human endothelin receptors known endothelin a eta and endothelin b etb receptors which are members of the seven transmembrane g protein-coupled rhodopsin superfamily 14 15 . the eta and etb receptor genes are located on chromosomes 4 and 13 respectively. eta has a higher affinity for et-1 and et-2 than et-3 but all three have equal affinity for etb receptors. a third receptor subtype endothelin c with high affinity for et-3 has been isolated and cloned from xenopus laevis 16 . eta receptors in normal lung are found in greatest abundance on vascular and airway smooth muscle whereas etb receptors are most often found on the endothelium. clearance of et-1 from the circulation is mediated by the etb receptor primarily in the lung but also in the kidney and liver 17 . activation of both eta and etb receptors on smooth muscle cells leads to vasoconstriction whereas etb receptor activation leads to bronchoconstriction. activation of etb receptors located on endothelial cells leads to vasodilation by increasing nitric oxide no production. the mitogenic and inflammatory modulator functions of et-1 are primarily mediated by eta receptor activity. binding of the ligand to its receptor results in coupling of cell-specific g proteins that activate or inhibit adenylate cyclase stimulate phosphatidyl-inositol-specific phosholipase open voltage gated calcium and potassium channels and so on. the varied effects of et-1 receptor activation thus depend on the g protein and signal transduction pathways active in the cell of interest 18 . a growing number of receptor antagonists exist with variable selectivity for one or both receptor subtypes. regulation of et-1 is at the level of transcription with stimuli including shear stress hypoxia cytokines il-2 il-1β tumor necrosis factor α ifn-β etc lipopolysaccharides and many growth factors transforming growth factor β platelet-derived growth factor epidermal growth factor etc inducing transcription of et-1 mrna and secretion of protein 18 . et-1 acting in an autocrine fashion may also increase et-1 expression 19 . et-1 expression is decreased by no 20 . some stimuli may additionally enhance preproet-1 mrna stability leading to increased and sustained et-1 expression. the number of eta and etb receptors is also cell specific and regulated by a variety of growth factors 18 . because et-1 and receptor expression is influenced by many diverse physical and biochemical mechanisms the role of et-1 in pathologic states has been difficult to define and these are addressed in subsequent parts of this article. in the airway et-1 is localized primarily to the bronchial smooth muscle with low expression in the epithelium. cellular subsets of the epithelium that secrete et-1 include mucous cells serous cells and clara cells 21 . et binding sites are found on bronchial smooth muscle alveolar septae endothelial cells and parasympathetic ganglia 22 23 . et-1 expression in the airways as previously noted is regulated by inflammatory mediators. eosinophilic airway inflammation as may be seen in severe asthma is associated with increased et-1 levels in the lung 24 . et-1 secretion may also act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion via the eta receptor leading to increased transepithelial potential difference and ciliary beat frequency and to exerting mitogenic effects on airway epithelium and smooth muscle cells 25 26 27 28 . all three endothelins cause bronchoconstriction in intact airways with et-1 being the most potent. denuded bronchi constrict equally to all three endothelins suggesting considerable modulation of et-1 effects by the epithelium 29 . the vast majority of et-1 binding sites on bronchial smooth muscle are etb receptors and bronchoconstriction in human bronchi is not inhibited by eta antagonists but augmented by etb receptor agonists 30 31 32 . since cultured airway epithelium secretes equal amounts of et-1 and et-3 which have equivalent affinity for the etb receptor bronchoconstriction could be mediated by both endothelins 33 . while et-1 stimulates release of multiple cytokines important in airway inflammation it does not enhance secretion of histamine or leukotrienes. et-1 does increase prostaglandin release 32 . inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase however has no effect on bronchoconstriction suggesting that despite the release of multiple mediators et-1 mediated bronchoconstriction is a direct effect of activation of the etb receptor 32 . eta mediated bronchoconstriction may also be important following etb receptor desensitization or denudation of the airway epithelium as may occur during airway inflammation and during the late sustained airway response to inhaled antigens 31 34 35 . interestingly heterozygous et-1 knockout mice with a 50 reduction in et-1 peptide have airway hyperresponsiveness but not remodeling suggesting the decrease in et-1 modulates bronchoconstriction activity by a functional mechanism possibly by decreasing basal no production 36 37 . asthma is also an inflammatory airway disease characterized by bronchoconstriction and hyperreactivity with influx of inflammatory cells mucus production edema and airway thickening. et-1 may have important roles in each of these processes. while et-1 causes immediate bronchoconstriction 38 it also increases bronchial reactivity to inhaled antigens 35 as well as influx of inflammatory cells 39 40 increased cytokine production 40 airway edema 41 and airway remodeling 28 42 43 . airway inflammation also leads to increased et-1 synthesis possibly perpetuating the inflammation and bronchoconstriction 44 . et-1 release from cultured peripheral mononuclear and bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatics is also increased 45 46 . inhibition of eta or combined eta and etb receptors additionally leads to decreased airway inflammation in antigen-challenged animals suggesting that the proinflammatory effects of et-1 in the airway are mediated by eta receptors 39 47 . children with asthma have increased circulating levels of et-1 48 . adult asthmatics have normal levels between attacks but during acute attacks have elevated serum et-1 levels that correlate inversely with airflow measurements and decrease with treatment 49 . bronchoalveolar lavage bal et-1 in asthmatics is similarly increased to concentrations that cause bronchoconstriction and inversely correlates with forced expiratory volume in 1 s fev1 29 50 51 . as in cultured epithelial cells et-1 and et-3 are found in equal amounts in bal fluid from asthmatics 33 52 . there is also a relative increase in etb versus eta receptor expression in asthmatic patients which may contribute to increased bronchoconstriction 53 . not all asthmatics however have increased et-1 as patients with nocturnal asthma have decreased bal et-1 levels 54 . treatment of acute asthma exacerbations with steroids beta-adrenergic agonists or phosphodiesterase inhibitors resulted in decreased bal et-1 52 55 . immunostaining and in situ hybridization for et-1 in biopsy specimens from asthmatics have shown an increase in et-1 in the bronchial epithelium that correlates with asthma symptoms 46 56 . cigarette smoking leads to increased circulating et-1 57 but patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the absence of pulmonary hypertension and hypoxemia do not have increased plasma et-1 58 59 60 . increases in urinary et-1 instead correlate with decreases in oxygenation possibly through hypoxic release of et-1 from the kidney 61 62 . smokers also have impaired et-1 mediated vasodilation that correlates with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and may contribute to pulmonary hypertension 63 64 . et-1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis by its ability to promote neutrophil chemotaxis adherence and activation 65 66 67 68 69 . sputum et-1 levels are increased in patients with cystic fibrosis 59 and sputum et-1 correlated with pseduomonas infection in noncystic fibrosis related bronchiectasis 70 . et-1 has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis obliterans bo which is characterized by injury to small conducting airways resulting in formation of proliferative collagen rich tissue obliterating airway architecture. bo is the leading cause of late mortality from lung transplantation and et-1 is increased in lung allografts 71 . the pro-inflammatory and mitogenic properties of et-1 in the airways has led to speculation that et-1 may be involved in formation of the lesion 28 . this is further supported by the increase in bal et-1 in lung allografts 72 73 . the in vivo gene transfer of et-1 to the airway epithelium using the hemagglutinating virus of japan in rats recently resulted in pathologic changes in the distal airways identical to those seen in human bo specimens 74 . these changes were not due to nonspecific effects of the hemagglutinating virus of japan itself but could be attributed to the presence of the et-1 gene which was localized to the airway epithelium hyperplastic lesions and alveolar cells. pulmonary hypertension is a rare and progressive disease characterized by increases in normally low pulmonary vascular tone pulmonary vascular remodeling and progressive right heart failure. et-1 has been implicated as a mediator in the changes seen in pulmonary hypertension. in the pulmonary vasculature et-1 is found primarily in endothelial cells and to a lesser extent in the vascular smooth muscle cells. the endothelium secretes et-1 primarily to the basolateral surface of the cell. et-1 secretion may be increased by a variety of stimuli including cytokines catecholamines and physical forces such as shear stress and decreased by no prostaglandins and oxidant stress 20 75 76 77 78 . hypoxia has been reported to increase have no effect or decrease et-1 release from endothelial cells 79 80 81 82 83 . activation of the receptors for et-1 in the pulmonary vasculature leads to both vasodilation and vasoconstriction and depends on both cell type and receptor. in the whole lung eta receptors are the most abundant and are localized to the medial layer of the arteries decreasing in intensity in the peripheral circulation 84 85 . etb receptors are also found in the media of the pulmonary vessels increasing in intensity in the distal circulation while intimal etb receptors are localized in the larger elastic arteries 85 . this distribution of receptors has important implications in understanding et-1 regulation of vascular tone. vascular et-1 receptors may be increased by several factors including angiotensin and hypoxia 80 85 86 87 . et-1 can act as both a vasodilator and vasoconstrictor in the pulmonary circulation. generation of no or opening of atp-sensitive potassium channels leading to hyperpolarization results in vasodilation mediated by etb receptors on pulmonary endothelium 88 89 . in hypertensive chronically hypoxic lungs with increased etb receptor expression augmented vasodilation is due to increased etb mediated no release that is inhibited by hypoxic ventilation while inhibition of no synthesis leads to increased et-1 mediated vasoconstriction 85 90 91 92 . both eta and etb receptors conversely acting on vascular smooth muscle mediate et-1 induced vasoconstriction. in the normal lung et-1 causes vasoconstriction primarily by activation of the eta receptors in the large conducting vessels of the lung 93 94 . in the smaller resistance vessels of the lung etb receptors in the media predominate and are responsible for the et-1 induced vasoconstriction 93 . interestingly preconstriction of the pulmonary circulation resulted in a shift from primarily eta mediated to etb mediated vasoconstriction 94 . the overall effect of et-1 on vascular tone depends on both the dose and on the pre-existing tone in the lung. et-1 administration during acute hypoxic vasoconstriction will result in transient pulmonary vasodilation 89 . this effect is dose dependent with lower doses leading to vasodilation while higher or repetitive doses cause vasoconstriction following an initial brief vasodilation 89 . the role of et-1 in the acute hypoxic vasoconstriction in the lung is not certain. eta receptor antagonism attenuates hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in several species 95 and et-1 may be implicated in the mechanism of acute hypoxic response by inhibition of k-atp channels 96 . several lines of evidence have suggested the importance of et-1 in chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. et-1 is increased in plasma and lungs of rats following exposure to hypoxia 80 97 . treatment with either eta or combined eta and etb receptor antagonists additionally attenuates the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension 98 99 . et-1 has also been implicated in the vascular remodeling associated with chronic hypoxia through its mitogenic effects on vascular smooth muscle cells 98 100 . et-1 has also been implicated in other animal models of pulmonary hypertension. et-1 is increased in fawn hooded rats that develop severe pulmonary hypertension when raised under conditions of mild hypoxia and in monocrotaline treated rats 101 102 . the increase in et-1 in both of these forms of pulmonary hypertension may be contributing to increases in vascular tone as well as in vascular remodeling 103 104 105 106 114 . interestingly transgenic mice overexpressing the human preproet-1 gene with modestly increased lung et-1 levels 35-50 do not develop pulmonary hypertension under normoxic conditions or an exaggerated response to chronic hypoxia 107 . human pulmonary hypertension is classified as primary or unexplained or secondary to other cardiopulmonary diseases or connective tissue diseases ie scleroderma . hallmarks of the disease include progressive increases in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular remodeling with thickening of the medial layer small pulmonary arterioles and formation of the complex plexiform lesion 108 . circulating et-1 is increased in humans with pulmonary hypertension either primary or due to other cardiopulmonary disease 109 . levels are highest in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. since the lung is the major source for clearance of et-1 from the circulation increased arterio-venous ratios as seen in primary pulmonary hypertension suggest either decreased clearance or increased production in the lung 17 109 . et-1 is also increased in lungs of patients with pulmonary hypertension with the greatest increase seen in the small resistance arteries and the plexiform lesions 110 and may correlate with pulmonary vascular resistance 111 . interestingly treatment with continuous infusion of prostacyclin resulted in clinical improvement and a decrease in the arterio-venous ratio of et-1 112 possibly by decreasing et-1 synthesis from endothelial cells 76 . studies using et-1 receptor antagonists in the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension are underway and may offer hope to patients with this disease by inhibiting this pluripotent peptide's effects on vascular tone and remodeling. several lines of evidence suggest the importance of et-1 in lung allograft survival and rejection. the peptide has been implicated as an important factor in ischemia-reperfusion injury at the time of transplant as well as in acute and chronic rejection of the allograft. circulating et-1 is increased in humans undergoing lung transplant immediately following perfusion of the allograft. plasma et-1 increased threefold within minutes remained high for 12 hours following transplantation and declined to near normal levels within 24 hours 113 . this increase in et-1 correlated with the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance occurring about 6 hours post-transplantation suggesting that the release of et-1 in the circulation may have mediated this event. et-1 in bal fluid from recipients of lung allografts is similarly increased several fold and remains elevated up to 2 years post-transplant 72 73 . in recipients of single lung transplants et-1 was increased 10-fold in bal fluid from the transplanted lung compared with the native lung suggesting that the increase in et-1 was due to the graft and not the underlying disease requiring transplant 72 . et-1 in bal fluid did not however correlate with episodes of infection or rejection. the cellular source of et-1 in lung allografts is unknown. the expression of et-1 in nontransplanted human lungs is low and found primarily in the vascular endothelium 114 . transbronchial biopsy specimens obtained either for surveillance or for clinical suspicion of infection or rejection following transplantation revealed the presence of et-1 in the airway epithelium and in alveolar macrophages 115 . et-1 was occasionally seen in lymphocytes but not in the endothelium or pneumocytes. et-1 localization was no different in surveillance specimens compared with infected or rejecting lungs or changed over time from transplantation. this study suggests that the source of the increased bal et-1 in transplanted lungs is due to the increased number of alveolar inflammatory cells and de novo expression in the airway epithelium. the biologic importance of the et-1 from inflammatory cells is supported by the observation that peripheral mononuclear cells from dogs with mild to moderate lung allograft rejection cause vasoconstriction in pulmonary arterial rings which is attenuated by the eta blocker bq123 116 . analysis of et-1 binding activity in failed transplanted human lungs suggested that et-1 binding activity was not different compared with normal lung in the lung parenchyma bronchial smooth muscle or perivascular infiltrates. et-1 binding was however decreased in small muscular arteries pulmonary arteries and bronchial arteries in the failed transplants suggesting a role for et-1 in impaired vasoregulation of transplanted lungs 117 . ischemia-reperfusion injury is the leading cause of early post-operative graft failure and death. in its severest manifestation increased pulmonary vascular resistance hypoxia and pulmonary edema lead to cor pulmonale and death 118 . et-1 has been implicated as a mediator of these events. the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance observed in human recipients of lung allografts follows an increase in circulating et-1 and falls with decreases in circulating et-1 113 . a similar pattern is seen in dogs subjected to allotransplantation 119 . conscious dogs with left pulmonary allografts demonstrate an increase in both resting pulmonary perfusion pressure and acute pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to hypoxia 120 . administration of eta selective or combined eta and etb receptor blockers did not change the resting tone. etb receptor mediated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction appeared however to be increased in allograft recipients. in another study administration of a mixed eta and etb receptor antagonist sb209670 to dogs before reperfusion of the allograft resulted in a marked increase in oxygenation decreases in pulmonary arterial pressures and improved survival compared with control animals 121 . in a model of ischemia reperfusion inhibitors of ece additionally attenuated the increase in circulating et-1 and the severity of lung injury 122 . et-1 receptor antagonists did not however completely eliminate the ischemia-reperfusion injury suggesting that changes in other vasoactive mediators such as an increase in thromboxane a decrease in prostaglandins or a decrease in no may also contribute to the increased pulmonary vascular resistance. administration of no donor fk409 to both donor and recipient dogs before lung transplantation reduced pulmonary arterial pressure lung edema and inflammation and improved survival. this suggests that reductions in no following transplantation may be partly responsible for early graft failure 123 . treatment with no donor was also associated with a decrease in plasma et-1 levels. acute rejection is manifested by diffuse infiltrates hypoxia and airflow limitation and may lead to respiratory insufficiency and death. bal et-1 was increased in dogs during episodes of acute rejection that decreased with immunosuppressive treatment 124 . acute episodes of rejection in humans however are not associated with further increases in bal et-1 72 . chronic rejection of allografts manifested as bo is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in long-term lung transplant survivors 71 . the etiology of bo following transplant is unclear but may be related to repeated episodes of acute rejection chronic low-grade rejection or organizing pneumonia 125 . as discussed earlier a chronic increase in et-1 as seen in lung allografts may contribute to bronchospasm and proliferative bronchiolitis obliterans due to the bronchoconstrictor and smooth muscle mitogenic effects of et-1 28 126 . this is further supported by the increase of bal et-1 in the transplanted lung which is susceptible to bo but not the native lung in recipients of single lung transplants 72 . the mitogenic effects of et-1 may play a role in the development of pulmonary malignancy as well as metastasis to the lung. many human tumor cell lines including prostate breast gastric ovary colon etc produce et-1. the importance of the et-1 may lie in its mitogenic effects on tumor growth and survival. this has been suggested by blockade of eta receptors resulting in a decrease in mitogenic effects of et-1 in a prostate cancer and colorectal cell lines 127 128 . et-1 receptors in tumor cells may also be altered with increases in the eta receptor and downregulation of etb receptors 129 . other tumors may have an increase in etb receptors however and blockade of etb results in a decrease in tumor growth 130 131 . tumor cells may as a result of this altered balance lose the ability to respond to regulatory signals from their environment. et-1 may additionally protect against fas-ligand mediated apoptosis 132 . et-1 has been detected using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in pulmonary adenocarcinomas and squamous cell tumors and to a lesser extent small cell and carcinoid tumors 133 . in situ hybridization also demonstrated a similar pattern of et-1 mrna expression in non-neuroendocrine tumors. et-1 receptors have also been found in a variety of pulmonary tumor cell lines. eta receptors were found in small cell tumors adenocarcinomas and large cell tumors while etb receptors were expressed primarily in adenocarcinomas and small cell tumors 134 . ece which converts big et-1 to et-1 the committed step in et-1 biosynthesis was also found in human lung tumors but not in adjacent normal lung 135 . these findings combined with the presence of et-1 in lung tumors suggest a possible autocrine loop that sustains and supports the growth of lung tumors. a recent study however suggested that while eta and ece-1 were detectable in lung tumors these genes were downregulated compared with normal bronchial epithelial cell lines 136 . it was proposed that the role of et-1 in lung tumors is not that of an autocrine factor but that of a paracrine growth factor to the stroma and vasculature surrounding the tumor allowing angiogenesis. tumor angiogenesis is necessary for continued growth of the tumor beyond the limits of oxygen diffusion. the growth of vessels into the tumor is also important to metastatic potential of the tumor. et-1 may play an important role in angiogenesis and tumor growth and survival through induction of vascular endothelial growth factor expression and sprouting of new vessels into the tumor and surrounding tissue 137 138 . et-1 binding activity was found in blood vessels and vascular stroma surrounding lung tumors at the time of resection most markedly surrounding squamous cell tumors 139 . et-1 production may be further augmented by the hypoxic environment found within large solid tumors 140 . since metastasis is dependent on neovascularization et-1 may also be an important mediator of this phenomenon. et-1 receptor antagonists may have a useful role in the treatment of neoplastic disease by inhibiting growth as well as metastatic potential of human tumors. experimental lung injury of many different types results in increased circulating et-1 bal et-1 and lung tissue et-1 18 . et-1 levels in humans are also increased in sepsis burns disseminated intravascular coagulation acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 . et-1 increases also correlate with a poorer outcome with multiple organ failure increased pulmonary arterial pressure increased airway pressure and decreased pio2 fio2 while clinical improvement correlates with decreased et-1 levels 144 145 147 . the arterio-venous ratio for et-1 is increased in patients with ards but it is not clear whether this is due to increased secretion of et-1 in the lungs or decreased clearance 142 144 . in patients who succumbed to ards there was also a marked increase in tissue et-1 immunostaining in vascular endothelium alveolar macrophages smooth muscle and airway epithelium compared with lungs of patients who died without ards. interestingly these same patients also had a decrease in immunostaining for both endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the lung 148 . ards is also characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells in the lung. since et-1 may act as an immune modulator an increase in et-1 may contribute to lung injury by inducing expression of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor and il-6 and il-8 149 . these cytokines may in turn stimulate the production of many inflammatory mediators leading to lung injury. et-1 additionally activated neutrophils and increased neutrophil migration and trapping in the lung 65 66 67 68 69 . another hallmark of ards is disruption and dysfunction of the pulmonary vascular endothelium leading to accumulation of lung water. the role of endothelin in formation of pulmonary edema is uncertain. infusion of et-1 raises pulmonary vascular pressure but it is uncertain whether et-1 by itself increased pulmonary protein or fluid transport in the lung 150 151 152 . et-1 may rather be acting synergistically with other mediators to lead to pulmonary edema 153 154 . pulmonary fibrosis is the final outcome for a variety of injurious processes involving the lung parenchyma. the final common pathway in response to injury to the alveolar wall involves recruitment of inflammatory cells release of inflammatory mediators and resolution. the reparative phase occasionally becomes disordered resulting in progressive fibrosis. et-1 in the lung may be important in the initial events in lung injury by activating neutrophils to aggregate and release elastase and oxygen radicals increasing neutrophil adherence activating mast cells and inducing cytokine production from monocytes 65 66 67 68 69 149 155 . among the many cytokines induced by et-1 that are important in mediating pulmonary fibrosis are transforming growth factor-β and tumor necrosis factor α 156 157 . et-1 is also profibrotic by stimulating fibroblast replication migration contraction and collagen synthesis and secretion while decreasing collagen degradation 158 159 160 161 162 . et-1 additionally enhances the conversion of fibroblasts into contractile myelofibroblasts 43 163 . et-1 also increases fibronectin production by bronchial epithelial cells 164 . finally et-1 has mitogenic effects on vascular and airway smooth muscle 126 28 . et-1 may thus play an important role in the initial injury and eventual fibrotic reparative process of many inflammatory events in the lung. several lines of evidence regarding the importance of et-1 in pulmonary fibrosis are available. plasma and bal et-1 levels are increased in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 50 165 . lung biopsies from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have additionally increased et-1 immunostaining in airway epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes which correlates with disease activity 166 . scleroderma is commonly associated with pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. plasma and bal et-1 is increased in these patients 160 167 168 but it is unclear whether the presence of either pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary fibrosis increases these levels further 167 . bal fluid from patients with scleroderma increased proliferation of cultured lung fibroblasts which was inhibited by eta receptor antagonist. this suggests that the et-1 in the airspace may be contributing significantly to the fibrotic response 160 . an increase in et-1 binding has also been reported in lung tissue from patients with scleroderma associated pulmonary fibrosis 169 . pulmonary inflammatory cells also appear to be primed for et-1 production because cultured alveolar macrophages from patients with scleroderma and lung involvement secrete increased amounts of et-1 in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide 170 . these observations collectively suggest that augmented et-1 release may contribute to and perpetuate the inflammatory process. bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in animals is associated with increased et-1 expression in alveolar macrophages and epithelium 171 . the increase in et-1 proceeds the development of pulmonary fibrosis. the use of et-1 receptor antagonists has produced mixed results in limiting the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis. a decrease in fibroblast replication and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins in vitro but not a decrease in lung collagen content in vivo has been shown using eta or combined eta and etb receptor antagonists after bleomycin 172 . another group did however observe a decrease in fibrotic area in lungs of rats following bleomycin that were treated with a mixed eta and etb receptor antagonist 173 . while et-1 seems to correlate with pulmonary fibrosis it remains uncertain whether the increase in et-1 is a cause or consequence of the lung disease. pulmonary fibrosis was recently reported in mice that constitutively overexpress human et-1 107 . these mice were known to develop progressive nephrosclerosis in the absence of systemic hypertension 174 . the transgene was localized throughout the lung with the strongest expression in the bronchial wall. in the lung the mice developed age-dependent accumulation of collagen and accumulation of cd4 lymphocytes in the perivascular space. this observation suggests that an increase in lung et-1 alone may play a causative role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis 107 175 . since its discovery 12 years ago much evidence has accumulated regarding the biologic activity and potential role of et-1 in a variety of diseases of the respiratory track. as compelling as much of this evidence is the causal relationship between et-1 activity and disease is not complete. the increasing use of ece and endothelin receptor antagonists in experimental and human respiratory disorders will help to clarify the role of this pluripotent peptide in health and disease. ards acute respiratory distress syndrome bal bronchoalveolar lavage bo

expression in epithelial cells in response to pneumovirus infection', 'abstract': 'respiratory syncytial virus rsv and pneumonia virus of mice pvm are viruses of the family paramyxoviridae subfamily pneumovirus which cause clinically important respiratory infections in humans and rodents respectively. the respiratory epithelial target cells respond to viral infection with specific alterations in gene expression including production of chemoattractant cytokines adhesion molecules elements that are related to the apoptosis response and others that remain incompletely understood. here we review our current understanding of these mucosal responses and discuss several genomic approaches including differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction pcr and gene array strategies that will permit us to unravel the nature of these responses in a more complete and systematic manner.', 'body': \"rsv and pvm are viruses of the family paramyxoviridae subfamily pneumovirus they are enveloped single-stranded nonsegmented rna viruses that can cause intense viral bronchiolitis in humans and mice respectively. in its most severe form the lower respiratory tract infection caused by pneumoviruses is associated with the development of peribronchiolar infiltrates that are accompanied by submucosal edema and bronchorrhea and ultimately leads to bronchiolar obstruction and compromised oxygen transfer. as the infection is confined to the respiratory epithelium the responses of these cells are clearly of primary importance in determining the nature and extent of the resulting inflammatory process. most of our understanding of responses to pneumovirus infection has emerged from studies of rsv infection of human epithelial target cells in vitro a list of genes and or gene products produced by epithelial cells in response to rsv infection in vitro is provided in table 1. at the cellular level epithelial cells initially respond to rsv infection by reducing their ciliary beat frequency. production and release of chemoattractant cytokines chemokines can be observed as early as 12 h after infection leading to the recruitment of specific leukocyte subsets to the lung tissue. rsv-infected epithelial cells become resistant to tumor necrosis factor tnf -α-induced apoptosis but later fuse to form giant-cell syncytia and die by cellular necrosis. we review the molecular bases to the extent that they are understood of these specific responses and discuss several novel strategies that may permit us to study the responses to rsv and pvm infection in a more coherent and systematic manner. tristram et al 1 observed that explanted respiratory epithelial cells slow their ciliary beat frequency almost immediately after exposure to rsv with complete ciliostasis seen as early as 6 h after the initial infection. the molecular basis of ciliostasis remains completely unknown. the earliest reports on this subject described production of the neutrophil chemoattractant il-8 from tissue culture supernatants from rsv-infected cells 4 5 6 and in nasal secretions from patients with viral rhinitis 7 . il-8 has since been detected in lower airway secretions from patients with severe rsv bronchiolitis 8 and the neutrophil influx observed in response to this infection is probably due at least in part to the activity of this chemokine. at the cellular level il-8 production can be observed in response to inactivated rsv virions whereas il-8 production in response to active infection was inhibited by ribavarin amiloride and antioxidants 9 10 . several groups have demonstrated activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κb nf-κb in response to rsv infection and nf-κb is recognized for its central role in eliciting the production of il-8 9 11 12 . the transcription factor nf-il-6 is also produced in response to rsv infection 13 and participates in a co-operative manner with nf-κb in the regulation of il-8 gene expression 11 although later studies suggest that activator protein-1 may function preferentially in this role 14 . interestingly the nf-κb regulator iκbα which functions by inhibiting nf-κb activation in response to tnf-α was produced with different kinetics and does not promote a reversal of nf-κb activation in response to rsv infection as it does in response to tnf-α 15 . most recently casola et al 16 demonstrated that the il-8 promoter contains independent response elements with nucleotides 162 to 132 representing a unique rsv response element that is distinct from elements necessary for il-8 production in response to tnf-α. this concept of a stimulus-specific response will probably make an important contribution toward our understanding of how pneumoviruses promote transcription of unique and specific sets of independent gene products. the pleiotropic chemokine regulated upon activation normal t-cell expressed and secreted rantes has also been detected in supernatants from rsv-infected epithelial cells in culture 17 18 as well as in upper and lower airway secretions from patients infected with this virus 7 8 . rantes acts as a chemoattractant for eosinophils and monocytes in vitro although its role in vivo is somewhat less clear. similar to il-8 rantes can be produced in vitro in response to inactivated virions 8 and involves nf-κb activation binding and nuclear translocation 19 . however koga et al 20 demonstrated that stabilization of rantes mrna a response to rsv infection mediated in part by nucleotides 11 389 of the rantes gene is probably the primary mechanism underlying increased production and secretion of rantes protein. further studies will determine whether a similar mechanism is also in place for il-8 and other rsv-mediated responses. several groups have recently shown that macrophage inflammatory protein mip -1α is released from rsv-infected cells in culture 7 21 mip-1α was also detected in upper and lower airway secretions from rsv-infected patients 7 8 . interestingly of the three aforementioned chemokines mip-1α is the one that is most closely correlated with the presence of eosinophil degranulation products this together with data from our pvm model of pneumovirus infection 22 has suggested to us that mip-1α plays a pivotal role in eosinophil recruitment in response to primary pneumovirus infection. interestingly production of mip-1α in cell culture requires active viral replication 8 which suggests that this response may proceed by a mechanism that is completely distinct from that which elicits production of rantes and il-8. however no reports to date have addressed the molecular mechanism that underlies the rsv-mediated mip-1α response. increased expression of this cell-surface adhesion protein was observed in both respiratory epithelial cell lines 23 24 and in human nasal epithelial cells 25 in response to infection with rsv in vitro. chini et al 26 demonstrated that the expression of icam-1 mrna similar to il-8 and rantes was dependent on an intact nf-κb site in the gene promoter and demonstrated a role for the consensus binding site for the factor ccaat enhancer-binding protein. stark et al 27 demonstrated that icam-1 and cd18 expressed in response to rsv serve to enhance neutrophil and eosinophil binding to epithelial cells. cd18 is a polypeptide of the integrin family that functions in mediating cell cell interactions. several groups have observed expression of cd18 on epithelial cells in response to rsv infection 27 28 with cd18 shown to enhance the degranulation of eosinophils in this specific setting 28 . of particular interest are the recent findings relating expression of cd18 along with cd14 to earlier literature on bacterial superinfections in the setting of viral infections. earlier studies 29 30 reported enhanced binding of bacteria to respiratory epithelial cells that were infected with rsv findings that had clinical implications relating to acute bacterial otitis media in infants. two more recent studies addressed the question of binding sites. saadi et al 31 determined that two strains of the pathogen bordetella pertussis bound more efficiently to rsv-infected cells and that the binding was reduced upon pretreatment of the cells with anti-cd14 or anti-cd18 antibodies. similarly raza et al 32 reported that both cd14 and cd18 on rsv-infected epithelial cells contributed to the binding of nonpilate neisseria meningitidis. in vivo testing is required before the clinical significance of these intriguing findings can be appreciated. rsv-infected epithelial cells in culture do not show features that are suggestive of apoptosis ie no evidence of membrane blebbing fragmentation of chromosomal dna or characteristic changes in nuclear morphology . takeuchi et al 33 showed that although rsv-infected epithelial cells express a number of apoptosis-associated genes including interferon regulatory factor-1 il-1β-converting enzyme and caspase 3 they do not undergo formal apoptosis. as part of our attempts to understand mucosal responses in a more systematic manner see below we discovered that rsv-infected epithelial cells express the recently described antiapoptosis gene iex-1l 34 . in our studies we found that expression of iex-1l is a response to active virus no gene expression was observed in response to irradiated replication-incompetent virus. moreover expression of iex-1l is not observed in response to adenoviral infection suggesting that expression of this gene is not a universal response to cellular perturbation or indeed to all viral infections. functionally we also demonstrated that rsv infection protects epithelial cells from tnf-α-induced apoptosis an effect that is temporally associated with the expression of iex-1l. apoptosis is generally considered to be a highly efficient self-defense mechanism employed by host target cells because it permits the infected host to dispose of viral proteins and nucleic acids on a single-cell basis without inducing an inflammatory response. it is thus not surprising that many viruses have evolved strategies to circumvent this response. of interest krilov et al 35 demonstrated that monocytes and cord blood mononuclear cells are similarly protected from apoptosis when infected with rsv. although virus-induced protection from apoptosis appears advantageous to the virus alone another interpretation may be considered. because respiratory epithelial cells are now recognized as a major source of leukocyte chemoattractants and because leukocyte recruitment to the lung has been associated with enhanced viral clearance and prolonged survival in pneumovirus infection 22 the ability to maintain chemoattractant production from viable cells may ultimately benefit the host organism as well. in tissue culture rsv-infection is characterized by the formation of giant-cell syncytia. the mechanisms for the formation of these fused masses of cells depend in part on the expression of the rsv-specific fusion f protein on the surface of infected host cells and in part on virus-mediated changes in cytoskeletal architecture. it is important to note that rsv-induced changes in cytoskeletal architecture are not restricted to cell lines grown in vitro as giant-cell syncytia have also been found in pathologic lung specimens obtained from both humans and animals that were infected with rsv. again as part of our systematic study of gene expression in response to pneumovirus infection we found that human respiratory epithelial cells respond to rsv infection with increased expression of the cytoskeletal protein cytokeratin-17 36 . cytokeratin-17 is a 46-kda cytoskeletal protein that belongs to the class i acidic cytokeratin family. in the lung expression of cytokeratin-17 is normally restricted to basal epithelial cells of the larynx trachea and bronchi. in rsv-infected cells we found expression of ck-17 predominantly at sites of syncytia formation and thus provided the first description of a unique component of these pathognomonic structures at the molecular level. similar to what has been reported for the production of il-8 expression of ck-17 is dependent on the activity of the transcription factor nf-κb and future studies will determine the role of the nf-κb consensus site 200 to 208 of the cytokeratin-17 promoter in mediating this response. to date efforts to study pneumovirus-induced alterations in gene expression have relied heavily on in vitro models of virus-infected cells and cell lines. the intrinsic value of characterizing the genes identified in this artificial system is by definition limited and the clinical and physiologic significance of any findings must ultimately be tested in vivo. to some extent the study of gene products in clinical specimens is possible but this approach is limited cumbersome and dictated by sample availability. it is clear that an appropriate animal model of inflammatory bronchiolitis is required to characterize the alterations in gene expression discovered using the available in vitro models. although rsv has been used for the study of specific allergic reactions to viral antigens it is not a natural pathogen of mice and intranasal inoculation of virus at high titer results in at best a minimal primary infection with a correspondingly minimal inflammatory response. in order to study gene expression in response to primary pneumovirus infection in vivo we developed a novel mouse model of inflammatory bronchiolitis using the natural rodent pneumovirus pathogen and closest phylogenetic relative of rsv 37 pvm. we presented our initial findings on pvm infection in mice in three recent publications 22 38 39 . a summary of these findings is presented in table 2 and fig. 1. to begin we described the cellular and biochemical pathology observed in response to pvm infection in mice 38 . we found that infection could be established with as few as 30 plaque-forming units pfu of pvm in the inoculum with infection resulting in significant morbidity and mortality and viral recoveries in the order of 108 pfu g lung tissue. we also noted inflammatory bronchiolitis as among the immediate responses to this infection with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid containing virtually 100 neutrophils and eosinophils obtained as early as 3 days after inoculation. furthermore we found that infection was accompanied by the production of the proinflammatory chemokine mip-1α which was previously shown by cook et al 40 to be an important component of the inflammatory response to the orthomyxovirus influenza virus. we also described the role played by mip-1α in the pathogenesis of pvm-induced bronchiolitis 22 . specifically we explored the responses of gene-deleted mice to infection with pvm and found no inflammatory response in mice deficient in mip-1α expression mip-1α- - and only minimal virus-induced inflammation in mice that lacked the major mip-1α receptor on granulocytes chemokine receptor ccr 1 ccr1- - . although the inflammatory response is often considered to be unnecessary and indeed detrimental we demonstrated that the absence of granulocytic inflammation was associated with enhanced recovery of infectious virions as well as with accelerated mortality. these results suggest that the mip-1α ccr1-mediated acute inflammatory response protects mice by delaying the lethal sequelae of viral infection. our most recent report on this subject 39 presents a direct comparison between the responses of mice to challenge with pvm and rsv. although rsv is not a natural pathogen of mice it has been used extensively in mouse models of human infection because a limited or 'semipermissive' infection can be established via intranasal inoculation of virus at very high titers. in this regard we found as have others that rsv infection did not result in any measurable degree of morbidity and that viral recovery was significantly lower than that found in the inoculum these results suggested that there was no significant viral replication in mouse lung tissue. we further demonstrated that the inflammatory response to rsv challenge was minimal as few leukocytes were recruited to the lungs fig. 1 . taken together our results suggest that infection of mice with pvm provides a superior model for the study of acute inflammatory bronchiolitis in response to pneumovirus infection in vivo. the advantages of this model include the following clinical parameters morbidity and mortality that can be measured clearly and specifically clear evidence of viral replication in lung tissue with incremental recoveries that at peak are in excess of 108 pfu g in response to as few as 30 pfu in the inoculum and a dramatic granulocytic response that is modulated at least in part by the proinflammatory chemokine mip-1α and its receptor ccr1. differential display is a semiquantitative reverse transcription-pcr-based technique that is used to compare mrnas from two or more conditions of interest. both increased and decreased expression of specific amplicons will be evident an obvious advantage to this approach. total rna can be isolated from virus infected versus uninfected cells or mouse lungs both before and during infection and differential display is performed using degenerate t11 xy anchoring primers and random upstream oligomers as described elsewhere 34 36 . the resulting pcr products are separated by electrophoresis and the gel is dried and exposed to film. an example of our results comparing cdna amplicons from rna extracted from rsv-infected epithelial cells daily for 4 days is shown in fig. 2. differentially expressed bands are cut from the gel eluted and reamplified using the same primers that generated the original signal and northern blots generated from rna extracted from pneumovirus-infected cells or tissue over time and probed with the differentially expressed amplicons serve to confirm differential expression of the identified sequence. the dna sequences of the newly identified differentially expressed amplicons are compared with sequences present in the genbank database. viral sequences are expected to be upregulated over time and can be identified immediately because the entire genomes of both pvm and rsv are present in genbank. in cases in which the amplicon represents a newly discovered gene potential open-reading frames are compared with sequences that are present in the swiss protein database motifs that share homologies with known proteins represent important clues to the identity of the differentially expressed gene. with the help of differential display we have identified and characterized several genes that are upregulated in rsv-infected respiratory epithelial cells. two specific examples of genes that were found to be induced during rsv infection and later characterized as playing independent roles in the pathophysiology of rsv infection are the antiapoptosis gene iex-1l 34 and the gene that encodes the cytoskeletal protein cytokeratin-17 36 . unlike dna viruses which are known to encode virus-specific antiapoptosis genes rsv an rna virus with a small approximately 15.2 kb viral genome was shown to alter host cell expression of the apoptosis inhibitor iex-1l. after demonstrating that iex-1l mrna was present at sevenfold higher concentrations in rsv-infected respiratory epithelial cells when compared with uninfected cells we concluded that this cellular response protected against tnf-α-induced programmed cell death during viral infection. further efforts to determine which of the 11 rsv proteins participate in the transactivation of the iex-1l gene either directly or indirectly are ongoing. a second example of a gene that is specifically upregulated in rsv-infected respiratory epithelium as identified by differential display is that which encodes cytokeratin-17 36 . upon characterizing the molecular events that are important for cytokeratin-17 induction we demonstrated a link to an nf-κb signaling pathway. above we discussed the importance of this transcription factor in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression and because of this involvement we were not surprised to discover its role in virus-induced cytokeratin-17 gene regulation. perhaps the most interesting observation made during these experiments was the in situ localization of cytokeratin-17 protein to areas of cytopathic syncytia formation suggesting a role for this cytoskeletal protein in their formation. of note we observed a dramatic decrease in rsv replication and in syncytia formation when we blocked cytokeratin-17 expression suggesting that blocking syncytia formation at least in part impairs the direct cell cell spread and productive replication of virus. although there are several companies that market these systems and components the cytokine gene macroarray systems recently developed by r d systems sigma genosys minneapolis mn usa and clontech atlas palo alto ca usa represent some of the newer opportunities available that have a focus on gene products that are known to be involved in inflammation. these arrays consist of different cdnas printed as pcr products onto charged nylon membranes. an example of our experience with the sigma genosys array is shown in fig. 3. for this example total rna was extracted from rsv-infected hep-2 cells and uninfected controls at day3 after infection. three micrograms of total rna was used in a cdna synthesis reaction using a proprietary mixture of 378 primer pairs and trace amounts of 32p-radiolabeled dctp. the resulting radiolabeled products were hybridized to the macroarrays overnight at 65 c and then washed and exposed to film. the arrow highlights one of the most obviously upregulated sequences from this experiment which was identified as the gene encoding human mip-1α. the physiologic importance of mip-1α upregulation during human rsv infection and during rodent pvm bronchiolitis has already been described. microarrays can be differentiated from macroarrays in several ways. among these differences the microarray matrix is a glass or plastic slide probes are labeled with fluorescent dye rather than via radioisotopes and most significantly microarrays generally include a larger number and a higher density of imbedded sequences than do macroarrays. although this may seem to be highly appealing at first the massive amounts of data generated by microarray technology poses new challenges with respect to data normalization management and development of mathematical models to assist in data interpretation. the pneumoviruses rsv and pvm enter respiratory epithelial cells via a receptor-mediated event. during host-cell attachment and internalization the target cell begins to alter its gene expression which among other events involves the transcriptional upregulation of cytokine and chemokine genes. as rsv replication progresses additional changes in cellular gene expression can be observed including induction of the potent antiapoptosis gene iex-1l and increased expression of the otherwise quiescent gene that encodes cytokeratin-17. what we know regarding the physiologic importance of these genes and their gene products has been described but there is more to be learned. as the available technologies evolve we can continue to capitalize on the use of genomic approaches as large-scale screening tools to identify genes that play important roles in the pathophysiology of pneumovirus infection. these elegant and simple tools will provide us with the means for thorough and systematic exploration of gene expression both in the established in vitro cell culture models and in our new murine model of acute pneumovirus infection. ccr chemokine receptor icam intercellular adhesion molecule mip macrophage inflammatory protein nf-κb nuclear factor-κb pcr

factor.\", 'combined': \"gene expression in epithelial cells in response to pneumovirus infection respiratory syncytial virus rsv and pneumonia virus of mice pvm are viruses of the family paramyxoviridae subfamily pneumovirus which cause clinically important respiratory infections in humans and rodents respectively. the respiratory epithelial target cells respond to viral infection with specific alterations in gene expression including production of chemoattractant cytokines adhesion molecules elements that are related to the apoptosis response and others that remain incompletely understood. here we review our current understanding of these mucosal responses and discuss several genomic approaches including differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction pcr and gene array strategies that will permit us to unravel the nature of these responses in a more complete and systematic manner. rsv and pvm are viruses of the family paramyxoviridae subfamily pneumovirus they are enveloped single-stranded nonsegmented rna viruses that can cause intense viral bronchiolitis in humans and mice respectively. in its most severe form the lower respiratory tract infection caused by pneumoviruses is associated with the development of peribronchiolar infiltrates that are accompanied by submucosal edema and bronchorrhea and ultimately leads to bronchiolar obstruction and compromised oxygen transfer. as the infection is confined to the respiratory epithelium the responses of these cells are clearly of primary importance in determining the nature and extent of the resulting inflammatory process. most of our understanding of responses to pneumovirus infection has emerged from studies of rsv infection of human epithelial target cells in vitro a list of genes and or gene products produced by epithelial cells in response to rsv infection in vitro is provided in table 1. at the cellular level epithelial cells initially respond to rsv infection by reducing their ciliary beat frequency. production and release of chemoattractant cytokines chemokines can be observed as early as 12 h after infection leading to the recruitment of specific leukocyte subsets to the lung tissue. rsv-infected epithelial cells become resistant to tumor necrosis factor tnf -α-induced apoptosis but later fuse to form giant-cell syncytia and die by cellular necrosis. we review the molecular bases to the extent that they are understood of these specific responses and discuss several novel strategies that may permit us to study the responses to rsv and pvm infection in a more coherent and systematic manner. tristram et al 1 observed that explanted respiratory epithelial cells slow their ciliary beat frequency almost immediately after exposure to rsv with complete ciliostasis seen as early as 6 h after the initial infection. the molecular basis of ciliostasis remains completely unknown. the earliest reports on this subject described production of the neutrophil chemoattractant il-8 from tissue culture supernatants from rsv-infected cells 4 5 6 and in nasal secretions from patients with viral rhinitis 7 . il-8 has since been detected in lower airway secretions from patients with severe rsv bronchiolitis 8 and the neutrophil influx observed in response to this infection is probably due at least in part to the activity of this chemokine. at the cellular level il-8 production can be observed in response to inactivated rsv virions whereas il-8 production in response to active infection was inhibited by ribavarin amiloride and antioxidants 9 10 . several groups have demonstrated activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κb nf-κb in response to rsv infection and nf-κb is recognized for its central role in eliciting the production of il-8 9 11 12 . the transcription factor nf-il-6 is also produced in response to rsv infection 13 and participates in a co-operative manner with nf-κb in the regulation of il-8 gene expression 11 although later studies suggest that activator protein-1 may function preferentially in this role 14 . interestingly the nf-κb regulator iκbα which functions by inhibiting nf-κb activation in response to tnf-α was produced with different kinetics and does not promote a reversal of nf-κb activation in response to rsv infection as it does in response to tnf-α 15 . most recently casola et al 16 demonstrated that the il-8 promoter contains independent response elements with nucleotides 162 to 132 representing a unique rsv response element that is distinct from elements necessary for il-8 production in response to tnf-α. this concept of a stimulus-specific response will probably make an important contribution toward our understanding of how pneumoviruses promote transcription of unique and specific sets of independent gene products. the pleiotropic chemokine regulated upon activation normal t-cell expressed and secreted rantes has also been detected in supernatants from rsv-infected epithelial cells in culture 17 18 as well as in upper and lower airway secretions from patients infected with this virus 7 8 . rantes acts as a chemoattractant for eosinophils and monocytes in vitro although its role in vivo is somewhat less clear. similar to il-8 rantes can be produced in vitro in response to inactivated virions 8 and involves nf-κb activation binding and nuclear translocation 19 . however koga et al 20 demonstrated that stabilization of rantes mrna a response to rsv infection mediated in part by nucleotides 11 389 of the rantes gene is probably the primary mechanism underlying increased production and secretion of rantes protein. further studies will determine whether a similar mechanism is also in place for il-8 and other rsv-mediated responses. several groups have recently shown that macrophage inflammatory protein mip -1α is released from rsv-infected cells in culture 7 21 mip-1α was also detected in upper and lower airway secretions from rsv-infected patients 7 8 . interestingly of the three aforementioned chemokines mip-1α is the one that is most closely correlated with the presence of eosinophil degranulation products this together with data from our pvm model of pneumovirus infection 22 has suggested to us that mip-1α plays a pivotal role in eosinophil recruitment in response to primary pneumovirus infection. interestingly production of mip-1α in cell culture requires active viral replication 8 which suggests that this response may proceed by a mechanism that is completely distinct from that which elicits production of rantes and il-8. however no reports to date have addressed the molecular mechanism that underlies the rsv-mediated mip-1α response. increased expression of this cell-surface adhesion protein was observed in both respiratory epithelial cell lines 23 24 and in human nasal epithelial cells 25 in response to infection with rsv in vitro. chini et al 26 demonstrated that the expression of icam-1 mrna similar to il-8 and rantes was dependent on an intact nf-κb site in the gene promoter and demonstrated a role for the consensus binding site for the factor ccaat enhancer-binding protein. stark et al 27 demonstrated that icam-1 and cd18 expressed in response to rsv serve to enhance neutrophil and eosinophil binding to epithelial cells. cd18 is a polypeptide of the integrin family that functions in mediating cell cell interactions. several groups have observed expression of cd18 on epithelial cells in response to rsv infection 27 28 with cd18 shown to enhance the degranulation of eosinophils in this specific setting 28 . of particular interest are the recent findings relating expression of cd18 along with cd14 to earlier literature on bacterial superinfections in the setting of viral infections. earlier studies 29 30 reported enhanced binding of bacteria to respiratory epithelial cells that were infected with rsv findings that had clinical implications relating to acute bacterial otitis media in infants. two more recent studies addressed the question of binding sites. saadi et al 31 determined that two strains of the pathogen bordetella pertussis bound more efficiently to rsv-infected cells and that the binding was reduced upon pretreatment of the cells with anti-cd14 or anti-cd18 antibodies. similarly raza et al 32 reported that both cd14 and cd18 on rsv-infected epithelial cells contributed to the binding of nonpilate neisseria meningitidis. in vivo testing is required before the clinical significance of these intriguing findings can be appreciated. rsv-infected epithelial cells in culture do not show features that are suggestive of apoptosis ie no evidence of membrane blebbing fragmentation of chromosomal dna or characteristic changes in nuclear morphology . takeuchi et al 33 showed that although rsv-infected epithelial cells express a number of apoptosis-associated genes including interferon regulatory factor-1 il-1β-converting enzyme and caspase 3 they do not undergo formal apoptosis. as part of our attempts to understand mucosal responses in a more systematic manner see below we discovered that rsv-infected epithelial cells express the recently described antiapoptosis gene iex-1l 34 . in our studies we found that expression of iex-1l is a response to active virus no gene expression was observed in response to irradiated replication-incompetent virus. moreover expression of iex-1l is not observed in response to adenoviral infection suggesting that expression of this gene is not a universal response to cellular perturbation or indeed to all viral infections. functionally we also demonstrated that rsv infection protects epithelial cells from tnf-α-induced apoptosis an effect that is temporally associated with the expression of iex-1l. apoptosis is generally considered to be a highly efficient self-defense mechanism employed by host target cells because it permits the infected host to dispose of viral proteins and nucleic acids on a single-cell basis without inducing an inflammatory response. it is thus not surprising that many viruses have evolved strategies to circumvent this response. of interest krilov et al 35 demonstrated that monocytes and cord blood mononuclear cells are similarly protected from apoptosis when infected with rsv. although virus-induced protection from apoptosis appears advantageous to the virus alone another interpretation may be considered. because respiratory epithelial cells are now recognized as a major source of leukocyte chemoattractants and because leukocyte recruitment to the lung has been associated with enhanced viral clearance and prolonged survival in pneumovirus infection 22 the ability to maintain chemoattractant production from viable cells may ultimately benefit the host organism as well. in tissue culture rsv-infection is characterized by the formation of giant-cell syncytia. the mechanisms for the formation of these fused masses of cells depend in part on the expression of the rsv-specific fusion f protein on the surface of infected host cells and in part on virus-mediated changes in cytoskeletal architecture. it is important to note that rsv-induced changes in cytoskeletal architecture are not restricted to cell lines grown in vitro as giant-cell syncytia have also been found in pathologic lung specimens obtained from both humans and animals that were infected with rsv. again as part of our systematic study of gene expression in response to pneumovirus infection we found that human respiratory epithelial cells respond to rsv infection with increased expression of the cytoskeletal protein cytokeratin-17 36 . cytokeratin-17 is a 46-kda cytoskeletal protein that belongs to the class i acidic cytokeratin family. in the lung expression of cytokeratin-17 is normally restricted to basal epithelial cells of the larynx trachea and bronchi. in rsv-infected cells we found expression of ck-17 predominantly at sites of syncytia formation and thus provided the first description of a unique component of these pathognomonic structures at the molecular level. similar to what has been reported for the production of il-8 expression of ck-17 is dependent on the activity of the transcription factor nf-κb and future studies will determine the role of the nf-κb consensus site 200 to 208 of the cytokeratin-17 promoter in mediating this response. to date efforts to study pneumovirus-induced alterations in gene expression have relied heavily on in vitro models of virus-infected cells and cell lines. the intrinsic value of characterizing the genes identified in this artificial system is by definition limited and the clinical and physiologic significance of any findings must ultimately be tested in vivo. to some extent the study of gene products in clinical specimens is possible but this approach is limited cumbersome and dictated by sample availability. it is clear that an appropriate animal model of inflammatory bronchiolitis is required to characterize the alterations in gene expression discovered using the available in vitro models. although rsv has been used for the study of specific allergic reactions to viral antigens it is not a natural pathogen of mice and intranasal inoculation of virus at high titer results in at best a minimal primary infection with a correspondingly minimal inflammatory response. in order to study gene expression in response to primary pneumovirus infection in vivo we developed a novel mouse model of inflammatory bronchiolitis using the natural rodent pneumovirus pathogen and closest phylogenetic relative of rsv 37 pvm. we presented our initial findings on pvm infection in mice in three recent publications 22 38 39 . a summary of these findings is presented in table 2 and fig. 1. to begin we described the cellular and biochemical pathology observed in response to pvm infection in mice 38 . we found that infection could be established with as few as 30 plaque-forming units pfu of pvm in the inoculum with infection resulting in significant morbidity and mortality and viral recoveries in the order of 108 pfu g lung tissue. we also noted inflammatory bronchiolitis as among the immediate responses to this infection with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid containing virtually 100 neutrophils and eosinophils obtained as early as 3 days after inoculation. furthermore we found that infection was accompanied by the production of the proinflammatory chemokine mip-1α which was previously shown by cook et al 40 to be an important component of the inflammatory response to the orthomyxovirus influenza virus. we also described the role played by mip-1α in the pathogenesis of pvm-induced bronchiolitis 22 . specifically we explored the responses of gene-deleted mice to infection with pvm and found no inflammatory response in mice deficient in mip-1α expression mip-1α- - and only minimal virus-induced inflammation in mice that lacked the major mip-1α receptor on granulocytes chemokine receptor ccr 1 ccr1- - . although the inflammatory response is often considered to be unnecessary and indeed detrimental we demonstrated that the absence of granulocytic inflammation was associated with enhanced recovery of infectious virions as well as with accelerated mortality. these results suggest that the mip-1α ccr1-mediated acute inflammatory response protects mice by delaying the lethal sequelae of viral infection. our most recent report on this subject 39 presents a direct comparison between the responses of mice to challenge with pvm and rsv. although rsv is not a natural pathogen of mice it has been used extensively in mouse models of human infection because a limited or 'semipermissive' infection can be established via intranasal inoculation of virus at very high titers. in this regard we found as have others that rsv infection did not result in any measurable degree of morbidity and that viral recovery was significantly lower than that found in the inoculum these results suggested that there was no significant viral replication in mouse lung tissue. we further demonstrated that the inflammatory response to rsv challenge was minimal as few leukocytes were recruited to the lungs fig. 1 . taken together our results suggest that infection of mice with pvm provides a superior model for the study of acute inflammatory bronchiolitis in response to pneumovirus infection in vivo. the advantages of this model include the following clinical parameters morbidity and mortality that can be measured clearly and specifically clear evidence of viral replication in lung tissue with incremental recoveries that at peak are in excess of 108 pfu g in response to as few as 30 pfu in the inoculum and a dramatic granulocytic response that is modulated at least in part by the proinflammatory chemokine mip-1α and its receptor ccr1. differential display is a semiquantitative reverse transcription-pcr-based technique that is used to compare mrnas from two or more conditions of interest. both increased and decreased expression of specific amplicons will be evident an obvious advantage to this approach. total rna can be isolated from virus infected versus uninfected cells or mouse lungs both before and during infection and differential display is performed using degenerate t11 xy anchoring primers and random upstream oligomers as described elsewhere 34 36 . the resulting pcr products are separated by electrophoresis and the gel is dried and exposed to film. an example of our results comparing cdna amplicons from rna extracted from rsv-infected epithelial cells daily for 4 days is shown in fig. 2. differentially expressed bands are cut from the gel eluted and reamplified using the same primers that generated the original signal and northern blots generated from rna extracted from pneumovirus-infected cells or tissue over time and probed with the differentially expressed amplicons serve to confirm differential expression of the identified sequence. the dna sequences of the newly identified differentially expressed amplicons are compared with sequences present in the genbank database. viral sequences are expected to be upregulated over time and can be identified immediately because the entire genomes of both pvm and rsv are present in genbank. in cases in which the amplicon represents a newly discovered gene potential open-reading frames are compared with sequences that are present in the swiss protein database motifs that share homologies with known proteins represent important clues to the identity of the differentially expressed gene. with the help of differential display we have identified and characterized several genes that are upregulated in rsv-infected respiratory epithelial cells. two specific examples of genes that were found to be induced during rsv infection and later characterized as playing independent roles in the pathophysiology of rsv infection are the antiapoptosis gene iex-1l 34 and the gene that encodes the cytoskeletal protein cytokeratin-17 36 . unlike dna viruses which are known to encode virus-specific antiapoptosis genes rsv an rna virus with a small approximately 15.2 kb viral genome was shown to alter host cell expression of the apoptosis inhibitor iex-1l. after demonstrating that iex-1l mrna was present at sevenfold higher concentrations in rsv-infected respiratory epithelial cells when compared with uninfected cells we concluded that this cellular response protected against tnf-α-induced programmed cell death during viral infection. further efforts to determine which of the 11 rsv proteins participate in the transactivation of the iex-1l gene either directly or indirectly are ongoing. a second example of a gene that is specifically upregulated in rsv-infected respiratory epithelium as identified by differential display is that which encodes cytokeratin-17 36 . upon characterizing the molecular events that are important for cytokeratin-17 induction we demonstrated a link to an nf-κb signaling pathway. above we discussed the importance of this transcription factor in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression and because of this involvement we were not surprised to discover its role in virus-induced cytokeratin-17 gene regulation. perhaps the most interesting observation made during these experiments was the in situ localization of cytokeratin-17 protein to areas of cytopathic syncytia formation suggesting a role for this cytoskeletal protein in their formation. of note we observed a dramatic decrease in rsv replication and in syncytia formation when we blocked cytokeratin-17 expression suggesting that blocking syncytia formation at least in part impairs the direct cell cell spread and productive replication of virus. although there are several companies that market these systems and

of total rna was used in a cdna synthesis reaction using a proprietary mixture of 378 primer pairs and trace amounts of 32p-radiolabeled dctp. the resulting radiolabeled products were hybridized to the macroarrays overnight at 65 c and then washed and exposed to film. the arrow highlights one of the most obviously upregulated sequences from this experiment which was identified as the gene encoding human mip-1α. the physiologic importance of mip-1α upregulation during human rsv infection and during rodent pvm bronchiolitis has already been described. microarrays can be differentiated from macroarrays in several ways. among these differences the microarray matrix is a glass or plastic slide probes are labeled with fluorescent dye rather than via radioisotopes and most significantly microarrays generally include a larger number and a higher density of imbedded sequences than do macroarrays. although this may seem to be highly appealing at first the massive amounts of data

contain a leader sequence derived from the 5 end of the genome fused to different sequences bodies derived from the 3 end. their generation involves a unique mechanism of discontinuous subgenomic rna synthesis that resembles copy-choice rna recombination. during this process the nascent rna strand is transferred from one site in the template to another during either plus or minus strand synthesis to yield subgenomic rna molecules. central to this process are transcription-regulating sequences trss which are present at both template sites and ensure the fidelity of strand transfer. here we present results of a comprehensive co-variation mutagenesis study of equine arteritis virus trss demonstrating that discontinuous rna synthesis depends not only on base pairing between sense leader trs and antisense body trs but also on the primary sequence of the body trs. while the leader trs merely plays a targeting role for strand transfer the body trs fulfils multiple functions. the sequences of mrna leader body junctions of trs mutants strongly suggested that the discontinuous step occurs during minus strand synthesis.', 'body': 'the genetic information of rna viruses is organized very efficiently. practically every nucleotide of their genome is utilized either as protein-coding sequence or as cis-acting signals for translation rna synthesis or rna encapsidation. as part of their genome expression strategy several groups of positive-strand rna rna viruses produce subgenomic sg mrnas reviewed by miller and koev 2000 . the replication of their genomic rna which is also the mrna for the viral replicase is supplemented with the generation of sg transcripts to express structural and auxiliary proteins which are encoded downstream of the replicase gene in the genome. sg mrnas of rna viruses are always 3 -co-terminal with the genomic rna but different mechanisms are used for their synthesis. some viruses such as brome mosaic virus initiate sg mrna synthesis internally on the full-length minus strand rna template miller et al. 1985 . others exemplified by red clover necrotic mosaic virus rcnmv may rely on premature termination of minus strand synthesis from the genomic rna template followed by the synthesis of sg plus strands from the truncated minus strand template sit et al. 1998 . members of the order nidovirales which includes coronaviruses and arteriviruses have evolved a third and unique mechanism which employs discontinuous rna synthesis for the generation of an extensive set of sg rnas reviewed by brian and spaan 1997 lai and cavanagh 1997 snijder and meulenberg 1998 . nidovirus sg mrnas differ fundamentally from other viral sg rnas in that they are not only 3 -co-terminal but also 5 -co-terminal with the genome figure 1a . a 5 common leader sequence of 65 221 nucleotides derived from the 5 end of the genomic rna is attached to the 3 part of each sg rna the mrna body . various models have been put forward to explain the co-transcriptional fusion of non-contiguous parts of the nidovirus genome during sg rna synthesis figure 1b and c . central to each of these models are short transcription-regulating sequences trss which are present both at the 3 end of the leader and at the 5 end of the sg rna body regions in the genomic rna. the trs is copied into the mrna and connects its leader and body part spaan et al. 1983 lai et al. 1984 . synthesis of sg mrnas initially was proposed to be primed by free leader transcripts which would base-pair to the complementary trs regions in the full-length minus strand and would be extended subsequently to make sg plus strands figure 1b baric et al. 1983 1985 . this model however was based on the report that sg minus strands were not present in coronavirus-infected cells lai et al. 1982 . the subsequent discovery of such molecules sethna et al. 1989 resulted in reconsideration of the initial leader-primed transcription model. sawicki and sawicki 1995 have proposed an alternative model figure 1c in which the discontinuous step occurs during minus instead of plus strand rna synthesis. in this model minus strand synthesis would be attenuated after copying a body trs from the plus strand template. next the nascent minus strand with the trs complement at its 3 end would be transferred to the leader trs and attach by means of trs trs base pairing. rna synthesis would be reinitiated to complete the sg minus strand by adding the complement of the genomic leader sequence. subse quently the sg minus strand would be used as template for sg mrna synthesis and the presence of the leader complement at its 3 end might allow the use of the same rna signals that direct genome synthesis from the full-length minus strand. using site-directed mutagenesis of trss of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus eav we have shown previously that base pairing between the sense leader trs and antisense body trss is crucial for sg mrna synthesis van marle et al. 1999a . however base pairing is only one step of the nascent strand transfer process and is essential in both models outlined in figure 1. the eav genomic rna contains several sequences that match the leader trs precisely but nevertheless are not used for sg rna synthesis den boon et al. 1996 pasternak et al. 2000 . this suggests that leader body trs similarity alone is though necessary not sufficient for the strand transfer to occur. to gain further insight into the cis-acting signals regulating sg rna synthesis we performed a comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis study of the eav leader and body trss. every nucleotide of the trs 5 -ucaacu-3 was substituted with each of the three alternative nucleotides. our analysis revealed a number of striking similarities with the process of copy-choice rna recombination as it occurs in rna viruses. whereas the leader trs plays only a targeting role in translocation of the nascent strand body trs nucleotides appear to fulfil diverse position-specific and base-specific functions. in addition the sequence of the leader body junctions of the sg mrnas produced by these mutants provided strong evidence for the discontinuous minus strand extension model. to dissect eav rna synthesis we routinely use a full-length cdna clone van dinten et al. 1997 from which infectious eav rna is in vitro transcribed. following transfection of the rna into baby hamster kidney bhk-21 cells intracellular rna is isolated and analysed by northern blot hybridization and rt pcr van marle et al. 1999a . due to differences in transfection efficiency the total amount of virus-specific rna genomic rna and sg mrna isolated from transfected cell cultures is somewhat variable. thus the accurate quantitation of sg mrna synthesis by trs mutants requires an internal standard for transfection efficiency. the amount of viral genomic rna can be this standard but only if its amplification is not dramatically affected by the trs mutations. to prove that this is the case we used the previously described mutants l4 b4 and lb4 van marle et al. 1999a in which five nucleotides of the trs 5 -ucaac-3 were replaced by the sequence 5 -aguug-3 either in the leader trs l4 rna7 body trs b4 or both trss lb4 . the three mutants were tested in three independent experiments. intracellular rna was isolated at 14 h post-transfection early enough to prevent spread of the wild-type control virus to non-transfected cells first cycle analysis . transfection efficiencies were determined by immunofluorescence assays see materials and methods and varied between 10 and 23 data not shown . prior to rna analysis the amount of isolated intracellular rna was corrected for the transfection efficiency of the sample so that each lane in figure 2 represents eav-specific rna from an approximately equal number of eav-positive cells. phosphoimager quantitation revealed that genomic rna replication of mutants l4 b4 and lb4 varied by not more than 30 table i . these differences could reflect for example a slight influence of rna secondary structure changes in the trs regions on genomic rna synthesis. remarkably however the genomic rna level of the leader body trs double mutant lb4 was not affected by more than 10 . in view of the results obtained with these pentanucleotide trs mutants we assumed that the amount of genomic rna could indeed be used as an internal standard during the analysis of mutants containing only single nucleotide replacements in leader trs and or rna7 body trs. there are numerous examples of regulatory rna rna interactions in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells as well as in rna viruses. essential processes such as translation replication and encapsidation of rna virus genomes frequently depend on rna rna interactions and higher order rna structures. regulation of sg rna synthesis of rna viruses by rna rna interactions is also not without precedent. in tomato bushy stunt virus an rna element located 1000 nucleotide upstream of the sg rna2 promoter base-pairs with the promoter and is necessary for sg rna production zhang et al. 1999 . similarly base pairing interactions between complementary sequences in the 5 end of the potato virus x genomic rna and sequences upstream of two major sg rna promoters are required for efficient sg rna synthesis kim and hemenway 1999 . in rcnmv an intermolecular rna rna interaction is required for sg rna synthesis sit et al. 1998 . recently we have established the pivotal role of an interaction between sense and antisense rna sequences in the life cycle of eav van marle et al. 1999a . in that study the role of trs nucleotides c2 and c5 was tested by substituting them with g. it was concluded that base pairing between the sense leader trs and the antisense body trs plays a crucial role in nidovirus sg rna synthesis. we now took a more systematic approach and performed an extensive site-directed co-variation mutagenesis study of the entire leader trs and rna7 body trs which directs the synthesis of the most abundant eav sg rna. every nucleotide of the trs 5 -uca acu-3 was replaced with each of the other possible nucleotides. as in the study of van marle et al. 1999a every mutation was introduced into leader trs rna7 body trs and both trss resulting in 54 mutant constructs. each mutant was given a unique name e.g. bu1a refers to a mutant in which a u has been changed to a at position 1 of the body trs lu1a refers to the same substitution in the leader trs and du1a means that these two substitutions were combined in one double mutant construct. the amount of sg rna7 was quantitated by phosphoimager scanning of hybridized gels and was corrected for the amount of genomic rna in the same lane as outlined above . figure 3 shows the relative sg rna7 level of the 54 mutants compared with the rna7 level of the wild-type control. for a selection of 11 interesting mutants see below the analysis was repeated three times figure 4 without observing significant variations in sg rna synthesis. the comprehensive analysis of the effects of trs mutations considerably expanded our understanding of discontinuous sg rna synthesis. remarkably the effects of single leader or body trs mutations were mostly base specific i.e. different nucleotide substitutions at the same position affected sg rna7 synthesis to different extents. for example at position 1 the bu1a mutant retained 44 of the wild-type rna7 synthesis level whereas both the bu1c and bu1g mutants lost rna7 synthesis almost completely. conversely when u1 of the leader trs was changed to a or g rna7 synthesis was completely abolished whereas 13 of the wild-type level was still maintained by lu1c. for position 2 only the bc2u mutant retained 30 of the wild-type rna7 synthesis level while all the other position 2 single mutants have lost 90 or more of wild-type rna7 synthesis. another example is position 6 bu6c left only 5 of wild-type rna7 synthesis whereas bu6a produced much higher rna7 levels. this implied that for some positions 1 2 and 6 certain mismatches in the duplex between plus leader trs and minus body trs such as u u bu1a and bu6a or c a lu1c and bc2u are allowed to a limited extent. in contrast no mismatches were allowed for position 5 where all single nucleotide substitutions abolished rna7 synthesis almost completely. surprisingly both body trs u to c substitutions at positions 1 and 6 bu1c and bu6c resulted in low levels of rna7 despite the fact that these mutations allow the formation of a g u base pair between the plus leader trs providing the u nucleotide and the minus body trs providing the g. on the other hand for positions 3 and 4 g u base pairing was shown to be functional because mutants la3g and la4g which can form g u base pairs between the g in the plus leader trs and u in the minus body trs were the only position 3 and 4 single mutants that produced reasonable levels of rna7. taken together these findings suggest that other factors besides leader body base pairing also play a role in sg rna synthesis and that the primary sequence or secondary structure of trss may dictate strong base preferences at certain positions. our analysis of the degree of complementation by the double mutants provided strong support for this assumption. for some trs nucleotides 2 5 and 6 except in the case of du6c the rna7 level of double mutants was clearly higher than that of the corresponding single mutants. this means that base pairing between these leader and body trs nucleotides is involved in sg rna synthesis. however none of these double mutants reached the wild-type sg rna7 level. in the other double mutants all position 1 3 and 4 mutants and du6c in clear contradiction to the predictions of the base pairing model rna7 synthesis was not significantly restored. moreover a comparison of the values for the b and d mutants in figure 3 showed that for almost all of these mutants e.g. the position 1 mutants the amount of sg rna7 produced by the double mutant appeared to be limited by the level allowed by the body trs mutation. sometimes the rna7 level of the double mutant was even less than that of the leader mutant du1c da3g da4g or du6c . clearly for these substitutions restoration of the possibilities for leader body duplex formation did not restore sg rna synthesis. apparently this is because the effect of body trs mutations at the level of primary sequence or secondary structure can be dominant over the duplex-restoring effects of the double mutations. body trs mutants thus fell into two distinct types determined by the position and chemistry of the substitution. in mutants of the first type sg rna synthesis was impaired mainly because of the disruption of the leader body trs duplex. this effect could be compensated for by introduction of the corresponding mutation in the leader trs and in the double mutant sg rna synthesis was restored compared with the corresponding single mutants. in mutants of the second type sg rna synthesis was down-regulated as a consequence of both trs duplex disruption and disruption of the primary sequence or secondary structure of the body trs. obviously the latter effect could not be compensated for by mutating the leader trs and the corresponding double mutants did not show restoration of sg rna synthesis. in contrast to our findings with the body trs mutants we did not obtain leader trs mutations that appeared to determine the level of sg rna7 synthesis of the corresponding double mutant figure 3 . thus effects of mutations in the leader trs were not dominant over the duplex-restoring effects of the double mutations suggesting that they only affected duplex formation. this indicated that the leader trs probably does not have an additional sequence-specific function in sg rna synthesis in addition to its participation in trs trs base pairing. the fact that single leader trs mutations at all six positions severely repressed rna7 synthesis indicated that base pairing of every trs nucleotide contributes to sg rna production. in this respect it was significant that the two leader trs mutants with the highest rna7 levels la3g and la4g can form g u base pairs to maintain the duplex. the observation that leader trs mutations could be rescued by introducing complementary mutations in the body trs but that many body trs mutations could not be rescued by corresponding changes in the leader trs is clearly illustrated by the u1a mutants. due to the restoration of trs base pairing possibilities the rna7 synthesis of double mutant du1a was significantly increased compared with that of lu1a but not above the level of bu1a. thus restoration of the leader body duplex in du1a exerted a clear effect on sg rna7 production compared with lu1a but had no effect on sg rna synthesis compared with bu1a. this exemplified the dominant nature of a mutation in the primary sequence of a body trs. in contrast for instance the bc2u mutation probably affected duplex formation only because rna7 synthesis was restored almost to wild-type levels in the dc2u double mutant. these results indicate that there are strong base preference constraints for some body trs positions. to interpret these base preferences accurately it is necessary to limit the analysis to the double mutants only because in these mutants the down-regulation of sg rna synthesis was only due to the sequence changes in the body trs and not to the disruption of the leader body trs duplex. there were strict preferences for positions 1 3 and 4 of the body trs at position 1 only the u to a substitution allowed for a significant rna7 level 40 of wild-type and at positions 3 and 4 only the a to u mutants retained 15 20 of the wild-type level. for positions 2 and 5 the sequence constraints were less stringent all substitutions allowed for 20 of wild-type level but still only dc2a and dc2u reached 50 . at position 6 of the body trs only u to c was not allowed whereas the other two double mutants still produced 50 or more of rna7. in other words the functional eav rna7 body trs based on the analysis of our single nucleotide substitutions can be described as u1 c u a 2a3a4c5 u a g 6 with wild-type nucleotides shown in upper case and nucleotides that allowed for at least 50 of the wild-type rna7 level shown in lower case. remarkably trs nucleotides a3 a4 and c5 are conserved in the trss of all other arteriviruses snijder and meulenberg 1998 . also the fact that dc2u retained 80 of rna7 synthesis corresponded nicely to the presence of a u at this position in other arteriviruses. until recently almazan et al. 2000 thiel et al. 2001 infectious cdna clones were lacking for coronaviruses. consequently most studies on coronavirus sg rna synthesis were carried out using defective interfering di rnas. these replicons carried body trss from which moderate levels of sg mrnas could be produced in the presence of helper virus. using this system joo and makino 1992 and van der most et al. 1994 performed body trs mutagenesis studies for the murine coronavirus mhv . joo and makino systematically mutagenized the core of the mhv body trs. in contrast to our results they found that in only two of 21 body trs mutants was sg rna synthesis from the di rna genome abolished whereas all others supported normal levels of sg rna production. thus it is possible that the mhv trs which was used in that study is more tolerant to single-nucleotide mismatches than the eav sg rna7 trs. in a similar study van der most et al. 1994 observed that u to c substitutions at positions 1 and 3 of the mhv body trs which maintained the duplex by changing a u a base pair into a u g base pair reduced sg rna levels more strongly than substitutions that disrupted the duplex van der most et al. 1994 . this implies that as in the case of eav leader body trs duplex formation is not the only factor that determines coronavirus sg rna synthesis. however because of the limitations of the di rna system the leader trs could not be mutagenized in these studies and body trs-specific effects could not be distinguished from effects at the level of leader body duplex formation. due to recent studies of arterivirus and coronavirus sg rna synthesis van marle et al. 1999a baric and yount 2000 sawicki et al. 2001 the discontinuous minus strand extension model figure 1c has been gaining more and more ground. this model predicts that the trs-derived sequence that forms the leader body junction in the sg mrna is a copy of the body trs and not of the leader trs. the leader-primed transcription model predicts the opposite figure 1b . therefore determining the origin of the leader body junction of sg mrnas would help to distinguish between the two models. however in the wild-type situation eav leader and body trss are identical and consequently one cannot determine the origin of the sg mrna leader body junction. this problem could be overcome by tracing the mutations introduced in leader or rna7 body trs mutants most of which retained part of their ability to produce mrna7. in a previous study van marle et al. 1999a we found that nucleotides 2 and 5 of the mrna7 leader body junction sequence were derived exclusively from the body trs and not from the leader trs. this was shown by direct sequencing of rt pcr products obtained from the residual mrna7 produced by mutants bc2g lc2g bc5g and lc5g van marle et al. 1999a . using the same approach we analysed mrna7 from mutants bc2a and bc2u and these transcripts also contained the mutated nucleotide derived from the body trs data not shown . assuming that only one crossover event occurs during leader body joining we could thus map this crossover between positions 1 and 2 of the sg rna junction sequence. this left the intriguing question of whether the crossover site could be mapped even more precisely. in other words was nucleotide 1 of the junction sequence derived from the body trs or the leader trs using the position 1 mutants described above we could answer this question figure 5 . the most striking result was that mrna7 of mutants bu1a bu1g and lu1c contained exclusively the body trs-derived nucleotide at position 1. thus for these mutants the crossover site could be mapped precisely between trs nucleotide positions 1 and 1 meaning that the complete leader body junction sequence in an eav sg mrna can be body trs derived. on the other hand sg rnas from mutants lu1a bu1c and lu1g contained mixed populations of leader trs- and body trs-derived nucleotides at position 1 figure 5 a and u for lu1a c and u for bu1c and g and u for lu1g. remarkably this pattern correlated with the relative amounts of sg mrna7 produced by these mutants figure 3 . mutants that produced populations of sg rnas that were mixed with respect to the origin of the nucleotide at position 1 of the leader body junction had lost rna7 synthesis almost completely. on the other hand mutants that contained exclusively the body nucleotide at position 1 retained higher levels of rna7 synthesis. this observation may be explained as follows in the wild-type situation the large majority of the crossovers probably occur between positions 1 and 1 leading to a body trs-derived nucleotide at position 1 in the sg rna however a low number of crossovers take place between nucleotides 1 and 2 resulting in a leader trs-derived nucleotide at position 1. mutants in which almost all sg rna synthesis is blocked by a substitution at position 1 may somehow be deficient in the crossover between 1 and 1 but may have retained the ability for crossovers between 1 and 2 which were detected by sequence analysis. conversely in position 1 mutants that retain reasonable sg rna synthesis most crossovers occur between positions 1 and 1 and they obscure the minority of crossovers between 1 and 2 in the sequencing electropherogram. alternatively position 1 trs mutations that strongly interfere with sg rna synthesis may force a shift of the crossover site in the remaining molecules. we believe that our present findings strongly support the discontinuous minus strand extension model. indeed the fact that a complete body trs can be copied into the sg rna is very difficult to reconcile with the alternative model in which sg rna synthesis from the genomic minus strand template is primed by free plus strand leader transcripts that contain the leader trs at their 3 end figure 1b . to explain the presence of a complete copy of the body trs in the sg mrna in this model one would have to assume that a 3 5 exonuclease activity trims back the free leader transcript prior to its extension into an sg mrna baker and lai 1990 . note that there would not be a single base pair left to hold these trimmed leader molecules on the template. such an enzymatic activity which is unprecedented in rna viruses exists in yeast retrotransposon ty5 ke et al. 1999 in which reverse transcription is primed by an internal region in a trna. however in this system it is not a part of the duplex that is removed but the single-stranded 3 tail of the trna which cannot base-pair with the ty5 rna. removal of the trs at the 3 end of the nidovirus leader which has already base paired with the template would be very energetically unfavourable for the rdrp. instead of starting elongation using the intact and properly positioned leader as a primer it would have to disrupt the newly formed duplex degrade part of the leader rna and then reinitiate polymerization without any base pairing between primer and template. it has been shown that influenza virus transcription does not require a sequence match between the cellular rna primer and the viral template plotch et al. 1981 . however if in the nidovirus system the trimmed leader rna could also be fixed on the template solely by rna protein interactions the targeting of the nascent strand by trs base pairing would be extremely puzzling. sequence data of sg rna leader body junctions from other arteriviruses are also difficult to reconcile with the leader-primed transcription model. for the porcine and simian arteriviruses meulenberg et al. 1993 godeny et al. 1998 the leader body junctions of some sg rnas mapped two nucleotides upstream of the body trs which again would not leave a single nucleotide to hold the putative free leader on the template after the hypothetical back trimming . on the other hand these findings and our data can be explained readily by the discontinuous minus strand extension model figure 1c . the six-nucleotide duplex formed between the body trs complement at the 3 end of the leaderless sg minus strand and the leader trs in the genomic rna template should suffice to position the nascent minus strand properly for subsequent elongation to add the complement of the leader sequence. in most cases the nascent minus strand contains the entire body trs complement at its 3 end at the moment of strand transfer leading to a body trs-derived leader body junction sequence in the sg mrna molecule. in a small number of transcripts however minus strand synthesis appears to be interrupted before nucleotide 1 of the body trs is copied and after strand transfer resumes by incorporating the complement of the 1 nucleotide of the leader trs. as stated above we postulate that the detection of this phenomenon is determined by the level of crossovers between the 1 and 1 position that is allowed by the mutations introduced at the 1 position of body trs or leader trs. we cannot however formally exclude that a back trimming activity degrades the 3 -terminal nucleotide of the minus strand before or after strand transfer. however note that in the discontinuous minus strand extension model figure 1c such an activity would not disturb the proper positioning of the nascent minus strand on the leader template because the trs trs duplex would be shortened by one nucleotide only. due to their discontinuous sg rna synthesis nidoviruses occupy a special niche in the rna virus world. their mode of sg rna production is clearly different from that of other rna viruses and resembles another well-documented rna virus feature rna recombination for recent reviews see nagy and simon 1997 aaziz and tepfer 1999 worobey and holmes 1999 . most of the experimental evidence supports an rdrp template switch kirkegaard and baltimore 1986 as the main mechanism of rna recombination. mechanistically such a template switch involves the transfer of a nascent strand from one rna template donor to the other acceptor . also nidovirus discontinuous sg rna synthesis involves transfer of a nascent rna strand the sg rna but now from one site to another in the same template. based on the data currently available we refer to the discontinuous minus strand extension model as our working model for nidovirus sg rna synthesis. if one applies the recombination terms to this model chang et al. 1996 brian and spaan 1997 van marle et al. 1999a the donor strand would be the body part of the genomic rna template the acceptor strand would be the leader part of the genomic rna template and the nascent strand would be the discontinuously synthesized minus strand. nagy and simon 1997 have defined three main classes of rna recombination similarity-essential similarity-non-essential and similarity-assisted recombination. the latter is defined as a mechanism in which strand transfer is determined by both sequence similarity between the parental rnas and additional rna determinants present in only one of the parental rnas. the results of our present study strongly suggest that nidovirus discontinuous sg rna synthesis can be considered a special case of high-frequency similarity-assisted rna recombination. while the only obvious function of the leader trs is to ensure the fidelity of the strand transfer by base pairing with the 3 end of the nascent strand the body trs in the donor template indeed has additional sequence-specific functions. one of these functions apparently is to pause or terminate nascent strand synthesis and thereby provide the opportunity for strand transfer. in addition body trs-derived nucleotides may play a role in the reinitiation of nascent strand synthesis on the acceptor template. given the compact nature of the eav trs it is quite possible that some nucleotides fulfil multiple tasks. the sequence-specific function of the body trs revealed in this study may be exerted at the level of either primary sequence or secondary structure. for a number of rna viruses rna secondary structure motifs located in the proximity of sg rna promoters are vital for sg rna synthesis. in alfalfa mosaic virus haasnoot et al. 2000 turnip crinkle virus tcv wang et al. 1999 and barley yellow dwarf virus koev et al. 1999 stem loop structures in sg rna promoter regions of the template strand are required for sg rna synthesis. the sg rna1 promoter of the latter virus is especially interesting since it contains two stem loop domains. for one of them secondary structure but not the primary sequence is important for sg rna synthesis whereas the other domain acts through primary sequence and not secondary structure koev et al. 1999 . similarly rna secondary structure may play only a minor role in the sequence-specific recognition of the bmv sg rna promoter by the rdrp adkins et al. 1997 siegel et al. 1997 . we have suggested previously that rna secondary structure of body trs regions contributes to their attenuating potential and thereby determines the relative portion of the nascent minus strands that is transferred to the leader trs in the template pasternak et al. 2000 . at present it is unknown whether eav body trss are part of an rna structural motif that is essential for body trs function or whether they are recognized by a protein factor in a sequence-specific manner. however the latter seems less likely than the former since even lb4 figure 2 in which five trs nucleotides were substituted still produced some sg rna7 although 30-fold less than the wild-type control. the fact that some sequences in the eav genome match the leader trs perfectly but are not used for sg mrna synthesis also argues against the recognition of a specific sequence pasternak et al. 2000 . more probably mutagenesis of the rna7 body trs disturbed an rna structure that is necessary for its function. this could for example explain the fact that the bu6c substitution reduced the amount of rna7 by 20-fold and could not be rescued by the same mutation in the leader trs whereas the wild-type rna6 body trs contains a c at the same position. if a protein factor were involved in sequence-specific trs recognition then one would expect it to recognize all trss similarly. if rna structure is important for recognition by such a protein then the bu6c substitution probably disturbs a structural motif of the rna7 trs which is not present in the rna6 trs. on the other hand conservation of part of the trs in other arteriviruses suggests a sequence-specific recognition. further studies are required to distinguish between these possibilities. in the tcv satellite rna recombination system the hairpin structure in the acceptor strand as well as the donor acceptor homology region are necessary for the template switch nagy et al. 1998 . the hairpin has been postulated to bind the rdrp whereas the homology region targets the nascent strand to the crossover site. the tcv rdrp probably recognizes the secondary and or tertiary structure of the hairpin while individual nucleotides play a less important role nagy and simon 1998 . in eav the leader trs in the acceptor template is predicted to reside in the loop of an extensive hairpin and its base pairing interaction with the body trs complement at the 3 end of the nascent minus strand would resemble certain antisense rna-regulated control mechanisms that are based on interactions between single-stranded tails and hairpin loops van marle et al. 1999a and references therein . it is possible that the eav rdrp or its accessory proteins also binds to the stem of the long hairpin that presents the leader trs. in any case the leader trs itself does not seem to be recognized by a protein in a sequence-specific manner. the body trs is a better candidate to serve as a protein recognition site. this protein would then mediate the pausing of the nascent strand synthesis and or nascent strand transfer. this would resemble the dna-dependent rna polymerase i termination system in which specific dna-binding terminator proteins bind to termination sequences reeder and lang 1997 or a function of the hiv nucleocapsid protein which promotes the minus strand strong-stop dna transfer guo et al. 1997 . the eav replicase component nsp1 which recently was shown to possess an sg rna synthesis-specific activity tijms et al. 2001 may be a good candidate for such a regulatory role. residues predicted to form a zinc finger structure in nsp1 were shown to be necessary for sg rna synthesis. interestingly zinc finger structures in the hiv nucleocapsid protein facilitate strand transfer guo et al. 2000 . finally it should be noted that the rna structure of the nascent strand may also influence pausing strand transfer or reinitiation as illustrated by the fact that stable hairpin structures in the nascent strand promote termination of transcription by escherichia coli rna polymerase wilson and von hippel 1995 . site-directed mutagenesis of eav leader and body trss was carried out as described by van marle et al. 1999a and all mutant constructs were sequenced. following in vitro transcription from infectious cdna clones full-length eav rna was introduced into bhk-21 cells by electroporation as described by van dinten et al. 1997 . immunofluorescence assays with eav-specific antisera were performed at 14 h post-transfection as described by van der meer et al. 1998 . to visualize the nuclei for cell counting nuclear dna was stained with 5 µg ml hoechst b2883 sigma . cells were counted using the scion image software scion corporation and the percentage of transfected cells was calculated on the basis of the number of cells positive for the eav replicase component nsp3 pedersen et al. 1999 . for rna analyses cells were lysed at 14 h post-transfection. intracellular rna isolation was performed using the acidic phenol method as described by pasternak et al. 2000 . total intracellular rna was resolved in denaturing agarose formaldehyde gels. hybridization of dried gels with the radioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe e154 which is complementary to the 3 end of the eav genome and recognizes all viral mrna molecules genomic and subgenomic and phosphoimager quantitation of individual bands were performed as described by pasternak et al. 2000 . to determine the leader body junction sequence of sg mrna7 mrna7-specific rt pcrs were carried out as described by van marle et al. 1999b using an antisense rt and pcr primer from the rna7 body region and a sense pcr primer matching a part of the leader sequence. rt pcr products were sequenced directly as described by pasternak et al. 2000 using the leader-derived primer an abi prism sequencing kit perkin elmer and an abi prism 310 genetic analyser perkin elmer .', 'combined': 'sequence requirements for rna strand transfer during nidovirus discontinuous subgenomic rna synthesis nidovirus subgenomic mrnas contain a leader sequence derived from the 5 end of the genome fused to different sequences bodies derived from the 3 end. their generation involves a unique mechanism of discontinuous subgenomic rna synthesis that resembles copy-choice rna recombination. during this process the nascent rna strand is transferred from one site in the template to another during either plus or minus strand synthesis to yield subgenomic rna molecules. central to this process are transcription-regulating sequences trss which are present at both template sites and ensure the fidelity of strand transfer. here we present results of a comprehensive co-variation mutagenesis study of equine arteritis virus trss demonstrating that discontinuous rna synthesis depends not only on base pairing between sense leader trs and antisense body trs but also on the primary sequence of the body trs. while the leader trs merely plays a targeting role for strand transfer the body trs fulfils multiple functions. the sequences of mrna leader body junctions of trs mutants strongly suggested that the discontinuous step occurs during minus strand synthesis. the genetic information of rna viruses is organized very efficiently. practically every nucleotide of their genome is utilized either as protein-coding sequence or as cis-acting signals for translation rna synthesis or rna encapsidation. as part of their genome expression strategy several groups of positive-strand rna rna viruses produce subgenomic sg mrnas reviewed by miller and koev 2000 . the replication of their genomic rna which is also the mrna for the viral replicase is supplemented with the generation of sg transcripts to express structural and auxiliary proteins which are encoded downstream of the replicase gene in the genome. sg mrnas of rna viruses are always 3 -co-terminal with the genomic rna but different mechanisms are used for their synthesis. some viruses such as brome mosaic virus initiate sg mrna synthesis internally on the full-length minus strand rna template miller et al. 1985 . others exemplified by red clover necrotic mosaic virus rcnmv may rely on premature termination of minus strand synthesis from the genomic rna template followed by the synthesis of sg plus strands from the truncated minus strand template sit et al. 1998 . members of the order nidovirales which includes coronaviruses and arteriviruses have evolved a third and unique mechanism which employs discontinuous rna synthesis for the generation of an extensive set of sg rnas reviewed by brian and spaan 1997 lai and cavanagh 1997 snijder and meulenberg 1998 . nidovirus sg mrnas differ fundamentally from other viral sg rnas in that they are not only 3 -co-terminal but also 5 -co-terminal with the genome figure 1a . a 5 common leader sequence of 65 221 nucleotides derived from the 5 end of the genomic rna is attached to the 3 part of each sg rna the mrna body . various models have been put forward to explain the co-transcriptional fusion of non-contiguous parts of the nidovirus genome during sg rna synthesis figure 1b and c . central to each of these models are short transcription-regulating sequences trss which are present both at the 3 end of the leader and at the 5 end of the sg rna body regions in the genomic rna. the trs is copied into the mrna and connects its leader and body part spaan et al. 1983 lai et al. 1984 . synthesis of sg mrnas initially was proposed to be primed by free leader transcripts which would base-pair to the complementary trs regions in the full-length minus strand and would be extended subsequently to make sg plus strands figure 1b baric et al. 1983 1985 . this model however was based on the report that sg minus strands were not present in coronavirus-infected cells lai et al. 1982 . the subsequent discovery of such molecules sethna et al. 1989 resulted in reconsideration of the initial leader-primed transcription model. sawicki and sawicki 1995 have proposed an alternative model figure 1c in which the discontinuous step occurs during minus instead of plus strand rna synthesis. in this model minus strand synthesis would be attenuated after copying a body trs from the plus strand template. next the nascent minus strand with the trs complement at its 3 end would be transferred to the leader trs and attach by means of trs trs base pairing. rna synthesis would be reinitiated to complete the sg minus strand by adding the complement of the genomic leader sequence. subse quently the sg minus strand would be used as template for sg mrna synthesis and the presence of the leader complement at its 3 end might allow the use of the same rna signals that direct genome synthesis from the full-length minus strand. using site-directed mutagenesis of trss of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus eav we have shown previously that base pairing between the sense leader trs and antisense body trss is crucial for sg mrna synthesis van marle et al. 1999a . however base pairing is only one step of the nascent strand transfer process and is essential in both models outlined in figure 1. the eav genomic rna contains several sequences that match the leader trs precisely but nevertheless are not used for sg rna synthesis den boon et al. 1996 pasternak et al. 2000 . this suggests that leader body trs similarity alone is though necessary not sufficient for the strand transfer to occur. to gain further insight into the cis-acting signals regulating sg rna synthesis we performed a comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis study of the eav leader and body trss. every nucleotide of the trs 5 -ucaacu-3 was substituted with each of the three alternative nucleotides. our analysis revealed a number of striking similarities with the process of copy-choice rna recombination as it occurs in rna viruses. whereas the leader trs plays only a targeting role in translocation of the nascent strand body trs nucleotides appear to fulfil diverse position-specific and base-specific functions. in addition the sequence of the leader body junctions of the sg mrnas produced by these mutants provided strong evidence for the discontinuous minus strand extension model. to dissect eav rna synthesis we routinely use a full-length cdna clone van dinten et al. 1997 from which infectious eav rna is in vitro transcribed. following transfection of the rna into baby hamster kidney bhk-21 cells intracellular rna is isolated and analysed by northern blot hybridization and rt pcr van marle et al. 1999a . due to differences in transfection efficiency the total amount of virus-specific rna genomic rna and sg mrna isolated from transfected cell cultures is somewhat variable. thus the accurate quantitation of sg mrna synthesis by trs mutants requires an internal standard for transfection efficiency. the amount of viral genomic rna can be this standard but only if its amplification is not dramatically affected by the trs mutations. to prove that this is the case we used the previously described mutants l4 b4 and lb4 van marle et al. 1999a in which five nucleotides of the trs 5 -ucaac-3 were replaced by the sequence 5 -aguug-3 either in the leader trs l4 rna7 body trs b4 or both trss lb4 . the three mutants were tested in three independent experiments. intracellular rna was isolated at 14 h post-transfection early enough to prevent spread of the wild-type control virus to non-transfected cells first cycle analysis . transfection efficiencies were determined by immunofluorescence assays see materials and methods and varied between 10 and 23 data not shown . prior to rna analysis the amount of isolated intracellular rna was corrected for the transfection efficiency of the sample so that each lane in figure 2 represents eav-specific rna from an approximately equal number of eav-positive cells. phosphoimager quantitation revealed that genomic rna replication of mutants l4 b4 and lb4 varied by not more than 30 table i . these differences could reflect for example a slight influence of rna secondary structure changes in the trs regions on genomic rna synthesis. remarkably however the genomic rna level of the leader body trs double mutant lb4 was not affected by more than 10 . in view of the results obtained with these pentanucleotide trs mutants we assumed that the amount of genomic rna could indeed be used as an internal standard during the analysis of mutants containing only single nucleotide replacements in leader trs and or rna7 body trs. there are numerous examples of regulatory rna rna interactions in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells as well as in rna viruses. essential processes such as translation replication and encapsidation of rna virus genomes frequently depend on rna rna interactions and higher order rna structures. regulation of sg rna synthesis of rna viruses by rna rna interactions is also not without precedent. in tomato bushy stunt virus an rna element located 1000 nucleotide upstream of the sg rna2 promoter base-pairs with the promoter and is necessary for sg rna production zhang et al. 1999 . similarly base pairing interactions between complementary sequences in the 5 end of the potato virus x genomic rna and sequences upstream of two major sg rna promoters are required for efficient sg rna synthesis kim and hemenway 1999 . in rcnmv an intermolecular rna rna interaction is required for sg rna synthesis sit et al. 1998 . recently we have established the pivotal role of an interaction between sense and antisense rna sequences in the life cycle of eav van marle et al. 1999a . in that study the role of trs nucleotides c2 and c5 was tested by substituting them with g. it was concluded that base pairing between the sense leader trs and the antisense body trs plays a crucial role in nidovirus sg rna synthesis. we now took a more systematic approach and performed an extensive site-directed co-variation mutagenesis study of the entire leader trs and rna7 body trs which directs the synthesis of the most abundant eav sg rna. every nucleotide of the trs 5 -uca acu-3 was replaced with each of the other possible nucleotides. as in the study of van marle et al. 1999a every mutation was introduced into leader trs rna7 body trs and both trss resulting in 54 mutant constructs. each mutant was given a unique name e.g. bu1a refers to a mutant in which a u has been changed to a at position 1 of the body trs lu1a refers to the same substitution in the leader trs and du1a means that these two substitutions were combined in one double mutant construct. the amount of sg rna7 was quantitated by phosphoimager scanning of hybridized gels and was corrected for the amount of genomic rna in the same lane as outlined above . figure 3 shows the relative sg rna7 level of the 54 mutants compared with the rna7 level of the wild-type control. for a selection of 11 interesting mutants see below the analysis was repeated three times figure 4 without observing significant variations in sg rna synthesis. the comprehensive analysis of the effects of trs mutations considerably expanded our understanding of discontinuous sg rna synthesis. remarkably the effects of single leader or body trs mutations were mostly base specific i.e. different nucleotide substitutions at the same position affected sg rna7 synthesis to different extents. for example at position 1 the bu1a mutant retained 44 of the wild-type rna7 synthesis level whereas both the bu1c and bu1g mutants lost rna7 synthesis almost completely. conversely when u1 of the leader trs was changed to a or g rna7 synthesis was completely abolished whereas 13 of the wild-type level was still maintained by lu1c. for position 2 only the bc2u mutant retained 30 of the wild-type rna7 synthesis level while all the other position 2 single mutants have lost 90 or more of wild-type rna7 synthesis. another example is position 6 bu6c left only 5 of wild-type rna7 synthesis whereas bu6a produced much higher rna7 levels. this implied that for some positions 1 2 and 6 certain mismatches in the duplex between plus leader trs and minus body trs such as u u bu1a and bu6a or c a lu1c and bc2u are allowed to a limited extent. in contrast no mismatches were allowed for position 5 where all single nucleotide substitutions abolished rna7 synthesis almost completely. surprisingly both body trs u to c substitutions at positions 1 and 6 bu1c and bu6c resulted in low levels of rna7 despite the fact that these mutations allow the formation of a g u base pair between the plus leader trs providing the u nucleotide and the minus body trs providing the g. on the other hand for positions 3 and 4 g u base pairing was shown to be functional because mutants la3g and la4g which can form g u base pairs between the g in the plus leader trs and u in the minus body trs were the only position 3 and 4 single mutants that produced reasonable levels of rna7. taken together these findings suggest that other factors besides leader body base pairing also play a role in sg rna synthesis and that the primary sequence or secondary structure of trss may dictate strong base preferences at certain positions. our analysis of the degree of complementation by the double mutants provided strong support for this assumption. for some trs nucleotides 2 5 and 6 except in the case of du6c the rna7 level of double mutants was clearly higher than that of the corresponding single mutants. this means that base pairing between these leader and body trs nucleotides is involved in sg rna synthesis. however none of these double mutants reached the wild-type sg rna7 level. in the other double mutants all position 1 3 and 4 mutants and du6c in clear contradiction to the predictions of the base pairing model rna7 synthesis was not significantly restored. moreover a comparison of the values for the b and d mutants in figure 3 showed that for almost all of these mutants e.g. the position 1 mutants the amount of sg rna7 produced by the double mutant appeared to be limited by the level allowed by the body trs mutation. sometimes the rna7 level of the double mutant was even less than that of the leader mutant du1c da3g da4g or du6c . clearly for these substitutions restoration of the possibilities for leader body duplex formation did not restore sg rna synthesis. apparently this is because the effect of body trs mutations at the level of primary sequence or secondary structure can be dominant over the duplex-restoring effects of the double mutations. body trs mutants thus fell into two distinct types determined by the position and chemistry of the substitution. in mutants of the first type sg rna synthesis was impaired mainly because of the disruption of the leader body trs duplex. this effect could be compensated for by introduction of the corresponding mutation in the leader trs and in the double mutant sg rna synthesis was restored compared with the corresponding single mutants. in mutants of the second type sg rna synthesis was down-regulated as a consequence of both trs duplex disruption and disruption of the primary sequence or secondary structure of the body trs. obviously the latter effect could not be compensated for by mutating the leader trs and the corresponding double mutants did not show restoration of sg rna synthesis. in contrast to our findings with the body trs mutants we did not obtain leader trs mutations that appeared to determine the level of sg rna7 synthesis of the corresponding double mutant figure 3 . thus effects of mutations in the leader trs were not dominant over the duplex-restoring effects of the double mutations suggesting that they only affected duplex formation. this indicated that the leader trs probably does not have an additional sequence-specific function in sg rna synthesis in addition to its participation in trs trs base pairing. the fact that single leader trs mutations at all six positions severely repressed rna7 synthesis indicated that base pairing of every trs nucleotide contributes to sg rna production. in this respect it was significant that the two leader trs mutants with the highest rna7 levels la3g and la4g can form g u base pairs to maintain the duplex. the observation that leader trs mutations could be rescued by introducing complementary mutations in the body trs but that many body trs mutations could not be rescued by corresponding changes in the leader trs is clearly illustrated by the u1a mutants. due to the restoration of trs base pairing possibilities the rna7 synthesis of double mutant du1a was significantly increased compared with that of lu1a but not above the level of bu1a. thus restoration of the leader body duplex in du1a exerted a clear effect on sg rna7 production compared with lu1a but had no effect on sg rna synthesis compared with bu1a. this exemplified the dominant nature of a mutation in the primary sequence of a body trs. in contrast for instance the bc2u mutation probably affected duplex formation only because rna7 synthesis was restored almost to wild-type levels in the dc2u double mutant. these results indicate that there are strong base preference constraints for some body trs positions. to interpret these base preferences accurately it is necessary to limit the analysis to the double mutants only because in these mutants the down-regulation of sg rna synthesis was only due to the sequence changes in the body trs and not to the disruption of the leader body trs duplex. there were strict preferences for positions 1 3 and 4 of the body trs at position 1 only the u to a substitution allowed for a significant rna7 level 40 of wild-type and at positions 3 and 4 only the a to u mutants retained 15 20 of the wild-type level. for positions 2 and 5 the sequence constraints were less stringent all substitutions allowed for 20 of wild-type level but still only dc2a and dc2u reached 50 . at position 6 of the body trs only u to c was not allowed whereas the other two double mutants still produced 50 or more of rna7. in other words the functional eav rna7 body trs based on the analysis of our single nucleotide substitutions can be described as u1 c u a 2a3a4c5 u a g 6 with wild-type nucleotides shown in upper case and nucleotides that allowed for at least 50 of the wild-type rna7 level shown in lower case. remarkably trs nucleotides a3 a4 and c5 are conserved in the trss of all other arteriviruses snijder and meulenberg 1998 . also the fact that dc2u retained 80 of rna7 synthesis corresponded nicely to the presence of a u at this position in other arteriviruses. until recently almazan et al. 2000 thiel et al. 2001 infectious cdna clones were lacking for coronaviruses. consequently most studies on coronavirus sg rna synthesis were carried out using defective interfering di rnas. these replicons carried body trss from which moderate levels of sg mrnas could be produced in the presence of helper virus. using this system joo and makino 1992 and van der most et al. 1994 performed body trs mutagenesis studies for the murine coronavirus mhv . joo and makino systematically mutagenized the core of the mhv body trs. in contrast to our results they found that in only two of 21 body trs mutants was sg rna synthesis from the di rna genome abolished whereas all others supported normal levels of sg rna production. thus it is possible that the mhv trs which was used in that study is more tolerant to single-nucleotide mismatches than the eav sg rna7 trs. in a similar study van der most et al. 1994 observed that u to c substitutions at positions 1 and 3 of the mhv body trs which maintained the duplex by changing a u a base pair into a u g base pair reduced sg rna levels more strongly than substitutions that disrupted the duplex van der most et al. 1994 . this implies that as in the case of eav leader body trs duplex formation is not the only factor that determines coronavirus sg rna synthesis. however because of the limitations of the di rna system the leader trs could not be mutagenized in these studies and body trs-specific effects could not be distinguished from effects at the level of leader body duplex formation. due to recent studies of arterivirus and coronavirus sg rna synthesis van marle et al. 1999a baric and yount 2000 sawicki et al. 2001 the discontinuous minus strand extension model figure 1c has been gaining more and more ground. this model predicts that the trs-derived sequence that forms the leader body junction in the sg mrna is a copy of the body trs and not of the leader trs. the leader-primed transcription model predicts the opposite figure 1b . therefore determining the origin of the leader body junction of sg mrnas would help to distinguish between the two models. however in the wild-type situation eav leader and body trss are identical and consequently one cannot determine the origin of the sg mrna leader body junction. this problem could be overcome by tracing the mutations introduced in leader or rna7 body trs mutants most of which retained part of their ability to produce mrna7. in a previous study van marle et al. 1999a we found that nucleotides 2 and 5 of the mrna7 leader body junction sequence were derived exclusively from the body trs and not from the leader trs. this was shown by direct sequencing of rt pcr products obtained from the residual mrna7 produced by mutants bc2g lc2g bc5g and lc5g van marle et al. 1999a . using the same approach we analysed mrna7 from mutants bc2a and bc2u and these transcripts also contained the mutated nucleotide derived from the body trs data not shown . assuming that only one crossover event occurs during leader body joining we could thus map this crossover between positions 1 and 2 of the sg rna junction sequence. this left the intriguing question of whether the crossover site could be mapped even more precisely. in other words was nucleotide 1 of the junction sequence derived from the body trs or the leader trs using the position 1 mutants described above we could answer this question figure 5 . the most striking result was that mrna7 of mutants bu1a bu1g and lu1c contained exclusively the body trs-derived nucleotide at position 1. thus for these mutants the crossover site could be mapped precisely between trs nucleotide positions 1 and 1 meaning that the complete leader body junction sequence in an eav sg mrna can be body trs derived. on the other hand sg rnas from mutants lu1a bu1c and lu1g contained mixed populations of leader trs- and body trs-derived nucleotides at position 1 figure 5 a and u for lu1a c and u for bu1c and g and u for lu1g. remarkably this pattern correlated with the relative amounts of sg mrna7 produced by these mutants figure 3 . mutants that produced populations of sg rnas that were mixed with respect to the origin of the nucleotide at position 1 of the leader body junction had lost rna7 synthesis almost completely. on the other hand mutants that contained exclusively the body nucleotide at position 1 retained higher levels of rna7 synthesis. this observation may be explained as follows in the wild-type situation the large majority of the crossovers probably occur between positions 1 and 1 leading to a body trs-derived nucleotide at position 1 in the sg rna however a low number of crossovers take place between nucleotides 1 and 2 resulting in a leader trs-derived nucleotide at position 1. mutants in which almost all sg rna synthesis is blocked by a substitution at position 1 may somehow be deficient in the crossover between 1 and 1 but may have retained the ability for crossovers between 1 and 2 which were detected by sequence analysis. conversely in position 1 mutants that retain reasonable sg rna synthesis most crossovers occur between positions 1 and 1 and they obscure the minority of crossovers between 1 and 2 in the sequencing electropherogram. alternatively position 1 trs mutations that strongly interfere with sg rna synthesis may force a shift of the crossover site in the remaining molecules. we believe that our present findings strongly support the discontinuous minus strand extension model. indeed the fact that a complete body trs can be copied into the sg rna is very difficult to reconcile with the alternative model in which sg rna synthesis from the genomic minus strand template is primed by free plus strand leader transcripts that contain the leader trs at their 3 end figure 1b . to explain the presence of a complete copy of the body trs in the sg mrna in this model one would have to assume that a 3 5 exonuclease activity trims back the free leader transcript prior to its extension into an sg mrna baker and lai 1990 . note that there would not be a single base pair left to hold these trimmed leader molecules on the template. such an enzymatic activity which is unprecedented in rna viruses exists in yeast retrotransposon ty5 ke et al. 1999 in which reverse transcription is primed by an internal region in a trna. however in this system it is not a part of the duplex that is removed but the single-stranded 3 tail of the trna which cannot base-pair with the ty5 rna. removal of the trs at the 3 end of the nidovirus leader which has already base paired with the template would be very energetically unfavourable for the rdrp. instead of starting elongation using the intact and properly positioned leader as a primer it would have to disrupt the newly formed duplex degrade part of the leader rna and then reinitiate polymerization without any base pairing between primer and template. it has been shown that influenza virus transcription does not require a sequence match between the cellular rna primer and the viral template plotch et al. 1981 . however if in the nidovirus system the trimmed leader rna could also be fixed on the template solely by rna protein interactions the targeting of the nascent strand by trs base pairing would be extremely puzzling. sequence data of sg rna leader body junctions from other arteriviruses are also difficult to reconcile with the leader-primed transcription model. for the porcine and simian arteriviruses meulenberg et al. 1993 godeny et al. 1998 the leader body junctions of some sg rnas mapped two nucleotides upstream of the body trs which again would not leave a single nucleotide to hold the putative free leader on the template after the hypothetical back trimming . on the other hand these findings and our data can be explained readily by the discontinuous minus strand extension model figure 1c . the six-nucleotide duplex formed between the body trs complement at the 3 end of the leaderless sg minus strand and the leader trs in the genomic rna template should suffice to position the nascent minus strand properly for subsequent elongation to add the complement of the leader sequence. in most cases the nascent minus strand contains the entire body trs complement at its 3 end at the moment of strand transfer leading to a body trs-derived leader body junction sequence in the sg mrna molecule. in a small number of transcripts however minus strand synthesis appears to be interrupted before nucleotide 1 of the body trs is copied and after strand transfer resumes by incorporating the complement of the 1 nucleotide of the leader trs. as stated above we postulate that the detection of this phenomenon is determined by the level of crossovers between the 1 and 1 position that is allowed by the mutations introduced at the 1 position of body trs or leader trs. we cannot however formally exclude that a back trimming activity degrades the 3 -terminal nucleotide of the minus strand before or after strand transfer. however note that in the discontinuous minus strand extension model figure 1c such an activity would not disturb the proper positioning of the nascent minus strand on the leader template because the trs trs duplex would be shortened by one nucleotide only. due to their discontinuous sg rna synthesis nidoviruses occupy a special niche in the rna virus world. their mode of sg rna production is clearly different from that of other rna viruses and resembles another well-documented rna virus feature rna recombination for recent reviews see nagy and simon 1997 aaziz and tepfer 1999 worobey and holmes 1999 . most of the experimental evidence supports an rdrp template switch kirkegaard and baltimore 1986 as the main mechanism of rna recombination. mechanistically such a template switch involves the transfer of a nascent strand from one rna template donor to the other acceptor . also nidovirus discontinuous sg rna synthesis involves transfer of a nascent rna strand the sg rna but now from one site to another in the same template. based on the data currently available we refer to the discontinuous minus strand extension model as our working model for nidovirus sg rna synthesis. if one applies the recombination terms to this model chang et al. 1996 brian and spaan 1997 van marle et al. 1999a the donor strand would be the body part of the genomic rna template the acceptor strand would be the leader part of the genomic rna template and the nascent strand would be the discontinuously synthesized minus strand. nagy and simon 1997 have defined three main classes of rna recombination similarity-essential similarity-non-essential and similarity-assisted recombination. the latter is defined as a mechanism in which strand transfer is determined by both sequence similarity between the parental rnas and additional rna determinants present in only one of the parental rnas. the results of our present study strongly suggest that nidovirus discontinuous sg rna synthesis can be considered a special case of high-frequency similarity-assisted rna recombination. while the only obvious function of the leader trs is to ensure the fidelity of the strand transfer by base pairing with the 3 end of the nascent strand the body trs in the donor template indeed has additional sequence-specific functions. one of these functions apparently is to pause or terminate nascent strand synthesis and thereby provide the opportunity for strand transfer. in addition body trs-derived nucleotides may play a role in the reinitiation of nascent strand synthesis on the acceptor template. given the compact nature of the eav trs it is quite possible that some nucleotides fulfil multiple tasks. the sequence-specific function of the body trs revealed in this study may be exerted at the level of either primary sequence or secondary structure. for a number of rna viruses rna secondary structure motifs located in the proximity of sg rna promoters are vital for sg rna synthesis. in alfalfa mosaic virus haasnoot et al. 2000 turnip crinkle virus tcv wang et al. 1999 and barley yellow dwarf virus koev et al. 1999 stem loop structures in sg rna promoter regions of the template strand are required for sg rna synthesis. the sg rna1 promoter of the latter virus is especially interesting since it contains two stem loop domains. for one of them secondary structure but not the primary sequence is important for sg rna synthesis whereas the other domain acts through primary sequence and not secondary structure koev et al. 1999 . similarly rna secondary structure may play only a minor role in the sequence-specific recognition of the bmv sg rna promoter by the rdrp adkins et al. 1997 siegel et al. 1997 . we have suggested previously that rna secondary structure of body trs regions contributes to their attenuating potential and thereby determines the relative portion of the nascent minus strands that is transferred to the leader trs in the template pasternak et al. 2000 . at present it is unknown whether eav body trss are part of an rna structural motif that is essential for body trs function or whether they are recognized by a protein factor in a sequence-specific manner. however the latter seems less likely than the former since even lb4 figure 2 in which five trs nucleotides were substituted still produced some sg rna7 although 30-fold less than the wild-type control. the fact that some sequences in the eav genome match the leader trs perfectly but are not used for sg mrna synthesis also argues against the recognition of a specific sequence pasternak et al. 2000 . more probably mutagenesis of the rna7 body trs disturbed an rna structure that is necessary for its function. this could for example explain the fact that the bu6c substitution reduced the amount of rna7 by 20-fold and could not be rescued by the same mutation in the leader trs whereas the wild-type rna6 body trs contains a c at the same position. if a protein factor were involved in sequence-specific trs recognition then one would expect it to recognize all trss similarly. if rna structure is important for recognition by such a protein then the bu6c substitution probably disturbs a structural motif of the rna7 trs which is not present in the rna6 trs. on the other hand conservation of part of the trs in other arteriviruses suggests a sequence-specific recognition. further studies are required to distinguish between these possibilities. in the tcv satellite rna recombination system the hairpin structure in the acceptor strand as well as the donor acceptor homology region are necessary for the template switch nagy et al. 1998 . the hairpin has been postulated to bind the rdrp whereas the homology region targets the nascent strand to the crossover site. the tcv rdrp probably recognizes the secondary and or tertiary structure of the hairpin while individual nucleotides play a less important role nagy and simon 1998 . in eav the leader trs in the acceptor template is predicted to reside in the loop of an extensive hairpin and its base pairing interaction with the body trs complement at the 3 end of the nascent minus strand would resemble certain antisense rna-regulated control mechanisms that are based on interactions between single-stranded tails and hairpin loops van marle et al. 1999a and references therein . it is possible that the eav rdrp or its accessory proteins also binds to the stem of the long hairpin that presents the leader trs. in any case the leader trs itself does not seem to be recognized by a protein in a sequence-specific manner. the body trs is a better candidate to serve as a protein recognition site. this protein would then mediate the pausing of the nascent strand synthesis and or nascent strand transfer. this would resemble the dna-dependent rna polymerase i termination system in which specific dna-binding terminator proteins bind to termination sequences reeder and lang 1997 or a function of the hiv nucleocapsid protein which promotes the minus strand strong-stop dna transfer guo et al. 1997 . the eav replicase component nsp1 which recently was shown to possess an sg rna synthesis-specific activity tijms et al. 2001 may be a good candidate for such a regulatory role. residues predicted to form a zinc finger structure in nsp1 were shown to be necessary for sg rna synthesis. interestingly zinc finger structures in the hiv nucleocapsid protein facilitate strand transfer guo et al. 2000 . finally it should be noted that the rna structure of the nascent strand may also influence pausing strand transfer or reinitiation as illustrated by the fact that stable hairpin structures in the nascent strand promote termination of transcription by escherichia coli rna polymerase wilson and von hippel 1995 . site-directed mutagenesis of eav leader and body trss was carried out as described by van marle et al. 1999a and all mutant constructs were sequenced. following in vitro transcription from infectious cdna clones full-length eav rna was introduced into bhk-21 cells by electroporation as described by van dinten et al. 1997 . immunofluorescence assays with eav-specific antisera were performed at 14 h post-transfection as described by van der meer et al. 1998 . to visualize the nuclei for cell counting nuclear dna was stained with 5 µg ml hoechst b2883 sigma . cells were counted using the scion image software scion corporation and the percentage of transfected cells was calculated on the basis of the number of cells positive for the eav replicase component nsp3 pedersen et al. 1999 . for rna analyses cells were lysed at 14 h post-transfection. intracellular rna isolation was performed using the acidic phenol method as described by pasternak et al. 2000 . total intracellular rna was resolved in denaturing agarose formaldehyde gels. hybridization of dried gels with the radioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe e154 which is complementary to the 3 end of the eav genome and recognizes all viral mrna molecules genomic and subgenomic and phosphoimager quantitation of individual bands were performed as described by pasternak et al. 2000 . to determine the leader body junction sequence of sg mrna7 mrna7-specific rt pcrs were carried out as described by van marle et al. 1999b using an antisense rt and pcr primer from the rna7 body region and a sense pcr primer matching a part of the leader sequence. rt pcr products were sequenced directly as described by pasternak et al. 2000 using the leader-derived primer an abi prism sequencing kit perkin elmer and an abi prism 310 genetic analyser perkin elmer .'}}\n",

rbc transfusions are often used in the treatment and management of this patient population. in fact one study 1 reported that 25 of all critically ill patients received rbc transfusions. many laboratory studies 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 have examined the physiological responses ie compensatory mechanisms of the body to anaemia which include the following 9 increased cardiac output decreased blood viscosity capillary changes increased oxygen extraction and other tissue adaptations to meet oxygen requirements. although critically ill patients are affected by a number of factors that predispose them to the adverse consequences of anaemia persistence of this condition is of particular concern because it may cause the compensatory mechanisms in these patients to become impaired risking oxygen deprivation in vital organs 9 . however critically ill patients may also be at increased risk from the adverse effects of rbc transfusions such as pulmonary oedema from volume overload immune suppression resulting in increased risk of infection and microcirculatory injury from poorly deformable rbcs. it is the aim of the present commentary to justify the statement 'transfusing to normal haemoglobin concentration will not improve outcome.' if we define normal haemoglobin as being greater than 115 g l for women and greater than 125 g l for men then there is no evidence in the literature to justify maintaining such high concentrations by the use of rbc transfusions in any anaemic patient. there may however be some debate about adopting a transfusion threshold of 100 g l which is well below 'normal'. it has recently been shown 10 that critically ill patients are able to tolerate lower levels of haemoglobin than was previously believed. the practice of adhering to a lower transfusion threshold would obviously reduce the number of allogeneic rbcs transfused. it is our goal to impress upon the reader that transfusing to a level equal to or greater than 100 g l does not improve mortality and other clinically important outcomes in a critical care setting. we first explore the reasons why a reduction in the total number of allogeneic blood transfusions would be beneficial. second we examine the current evidence for using a lower transfusion strategy specifically that employed in the transfusion requirements in critical care tricc trial. rbc transfusions have inherent risks that may be categorized as follows 11 12 13 14 15 transfusion-transmitted infections immune-related reactions acute or delayed haemolytic reactions febrile allergic anaphylactic reactions and graft-versus-host disease and nonimmune-related reactions fluid overload hypothermia electrolyte toxicity and iron overload . major improvements in donor screening procedures and laboratory testing have dramatically improved the safety of the blood supply 16 . currently the risk of transmitting an infectious agent through blood transfusion ranges from 1 100 000 for hepatitis b virus to 1 1 000 000 for hiv canadian blood services personal communication 2000 . the most important threats to the blood supply remain new and unknown pathogens. more recently concern has focused on the potential transmission of prions through rbcs. also infectious agents with long latency periods pose particular risks to young individuals who require rbcs such as multiple trauma victims. the risk benefit ratio for a 24-year-old trauma victim with a 50-year life expectancy differs markedly from that for a person aged 80 years who is undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. in summary because there is a risk of transmitting diseases through the blood supply we should always strive to use rbcs according to the best available evidence in order to ensure that we do more good than harm to our patients. it is a long-standing observation 17 18 19 20 21 that blood transfusions are associated with immune suppression. this clinical phenomenon was first observed in renal transplant patients who had received blood transfusions while on dialysis before the transplant 22 and has been observed repeatedly in transplant centres around the world 23 24 . recently opelz et al 25 reported a multicentre clinical trial in which all renal allograft recipients received modern immunosuppressive regimens. those patients who were allocated to receive three allogeneic rbc units before renal transplant had a 1-year graft survival rate of 90 as compared with 82 for patients who were not transfused p 0.02 . these data suggest that there are long-term immunosuppressive effects following transfusion of non-leukocyte-reduced allogeneic rbcs. a large number of studies 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 have also suggested that allogeneic transfusions accelerate cancer growth perhaps due to altered immune surveillance. these altered immune responses after allogeneic rbc transfusions may also predispose critically ill transfusion recipients to nosocomial infections 35 36 37 38 39 40 and increased rates of multiple-system organ failure 41 which may ultimately result in higher mortality rates. however most studies that examined the association between cancer recurrence and postoperative infection after transfusion 42 43 only provided weak causal inferences because of poor study design and the lack of independence between allogeneic rbc transfusions and the potential complication. a recent meta-analysis 44 combined the results from seven rcts and was unable to detect clinically important decreases in mortality and postoperative infections. we added the results of a new rct by van de watering et al 45 to the above meta-analysis. the relative risk for all-cause mortality was 1.05 95 confidence interval 0.88-1.25 and was 1.10 95 confidence interval 0.85-1.43 for postoperative infections. however this meta-analysis excluded two positive rcts 40 46 because of the significant statistical heterogeneity introduced by these two studies. if all available rcts are combined ignoring heterogeneity then the relative risk difference for postoperative infections across all studies is 1.60 95 confidence interval 1.00-2.56 p 0.05 . thus the available evidence suggests that universal prestorage leukoreduction could have clinical effects that range from none to decreasing rates of infection by as much as 50 in high-risk patients. in summary despite convincing laboratory evidence and some supportive clinical studies the clinical significance of the immunosup-pressive effects of allogeneic rbc transfusions have not been clearly established 47 . more importantly the impact of a leukoreduction programme has not been studied in a large population of patients who are expected to have significant exposure to allogeneic rbcs. the majority of complications from allogeneic rbc transfusion however are no more frequent in the intensive care setting than in other patient populations with the possible exception of pulmonary oedema hypothermia and electrolyte disturbance. hypothermia and electrolyte disturbances occur most frequently with massive transfusions. in critically ill patients the optimal effective circulatory volume may be difficult to determine and as a consequence pulmonary oedema may be a much more frequent complication of rbc transfusion than in other patient populations. this may explain the significantly higher rate of pulmonary oedema in patients transfused using a threshold of 100 g l 5.3 in the restrictive transfusion group versus 10.7 in the liberal transfusion group p 0.01 as reported in the tricc trial 10 . as an alternative explanation the more frequent use of rbcs might have resulted in more frequent episodes of transfusion-related acute lung injury in the liberal strategy group 7.7 in the restrictive strategy versus 11.4 in the liberal strategy p 0.06 as reported in the tricc trial. clinical evidence is also insufficient to definitively establish a correlation between the age of rbcs being transfused and patient mortality however laboratory evidence has shown many storage-related changes that may result in impairment of blood flow and oxygen delivery at the microcirculatory level. marik et al 48 demonstrated an association between a fall in gastric intramucosal ph and transfusion of rbcs stored for longer than 15 days. in addition there is ample laboratory evidence that prolonged rbc storage adversely affects rbcs potentially results in the generation of cytokines and alters host immune function. in another study fitzgerald et al 49 using an animal model of transfusion consistently observed a lack of efficacy of transfused stored rat blood to improve tissue oxygen consumption as compared with fresh cells or other blood substitutes. three retrospective clinical studies tested the association between the age of transfused blood and duration of stay in the intensive care unit icu 50 and mortality 51 52 . martin et al 50 observed a statistically significant association between the transfusion of aged blood 14 days old and increased duration of icu stay p 0.003 in 698 critically ill patients. in patients who received a transfusion aged rbcs was the only predictor of duration of stay p 0.0001 . in survivors only median age of blood was predictive of duration of stay p 0.0001 . purdy et al 51 demonstrated a negative correlation r -0.73 between the proportion of rbc units of a given age transfused to survivors and increasing age of rbcs in patients admitted to the icu with a diagnosis of severe sepsis n 31 . those investigators also noted that these latter units were more likely to be older. a recently reported study by vamvakas and carven 52 evaluated the effect of duration of rbc storage on postoperative pneumonia in 416 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. those investigators noted an adjusted increase of 1 in the risk of postoperative pneumonia per day of average increase in the duration of rbc storage p 0.005 in transfused patients. each of these three studies also noted that patients who received a large number of rbc units had a higher mortality. although these risks are relatively small when viewed collectively they become significant when one considers that 25 of all critically ill patients in canada are transfused during their icu stay 1 . until recently physicians have depended on clinical judgement when deciding at what haemoglobin level to transfuse a critically ill patient. as a result significant variation has been shown to exist in transfusion practice among canadian critical care physicians 53 which is due largely to a lack of published data on the subject. an arbitrary haemoglobin level of 100 g l has historically been used as a threshold to transfuse critically ill patients. six observational studies investigated the importance of anaemia on transfusion practices in various settings. of these three large cohort studies which were performed in different patient populations intensive care 1 coronary artery bypass surgery 54 and hip fractures 55 reached different conclusions. rbc transfusions in particular improved outcome in critically ill patients with cardiovascular disease but increased the risk of myocardial infarction in coronary artery bypass surgery patients. transfusion had no impact on short-term or long-term mortality in hip-fracture patients. three smaller studies 56 57 58 evaluated the relationship between anaemia and adverse outcomes in vascular disease patients. although increased numbers of ischaemic events were observed in anaemic patients the validity of these studies is uncertain given that the decision to transfuse a patient was often correlated with illness burden of the patient. it is also possible that comorbidity was not adequately adjusted for in those studies. transfusion thresholds were compared in 10 randomized clinical trials 10 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 . although the clinical settings varied each trial randomized patients to be transfused on the basis of a 'conservative' or a 'liberal' strategy. the definitions of conservative and liberal strategies varied and actually overlapped between studies. of these 10 trials only three included more than 100 patients and only one trial evaluated the impact of transfusion on symptoms. in the first trial of patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery 65 the differences between perioperative haemoglobin levels were small event rates were very low and there were no differences in any outcome. in the second trial 67 patients undergoing knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to receive autologous blood transfusion immediately after surgery or to receive autologous blood if haemoglobin level fell below 9 g dl 67 . again no differences in outcome were observed. the third trial of hip fracture patients undergoing surgical repair 64 found no differences in outcomes however five deaths were recorded at 60 days after surgery in the symptomatic group and two deaths occurred in the 10 g dl group. the numbers of patients in these trials were too small to evaluate the effect of lower transfusion triggers on clinically important outcomes such as mortality morbidity and functional status. in 1999 hebert et al 10 reported the results of the tricc trial. patients n 838 were randomized either to a restrictive strategy haemoglobin concentration maintained between 70 and 90 g l with a trigger set at 70 g l or to a liberal strategy haemoglobin concentration maintained between 100 and 120 g l with a trigger at 100 g l . to date the tricc trial is the only large study that has investigated these parameters. the groups were comparable at baseline. the average daily haemoglobin concentration ranged from 85 7.2 g l in the restrictive group to 107 7.3 g l in the liberal group p 0.01 . the average number of transfusions was reduced by 52 in the restrictive group 2.6 4.1 versus 5.6 5.3 rbcs patient p 0.01 . cardiac events primarily pulmonary oedema and myocardial infarction were more frequent in the liberal strategy p 0.01 table 1 . on examination of composite outcomes the number of patients with multiorgan failure was found to be substantially increased in both groups with the results being marginally better in the restrictive strategy group 20.6 versus 26.0 p 0.07 table 2 . overall the restrictive transfusion group showed a lower 30-day mortality 18.7 versus 23.3 p 0.11 fig. 1 . kaplan-meier survival curves however were significantly different in the subgroup of patients with an acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score of 20 or less p 0.02 fig. 2 . in addition although 60-day mortality 22.8 versus 26.5 p 0.23 and icu mortality 13.9 versus 16.2 p 0.29 were not statistically significant they did show a consistent trend in terms of absolute values that favoured the restrictive strategy. the key observation from the tricc trial is not that the restrictive strategy is better but rather that it is at worst equivalent to the liberal strategy and at best superior to the liberal strategy. at this juncture preclinical and clinical evidence support the adoption of a more restrictive transfusion strategy in most critically ill patients. however there remain divergent views regarding the risks and benefits of treating anaemia in patients with cardiovascular disease. laboratory-based studies 68 69 suggest that patients with cardiovascular disease may require higher haemoglobin concentrations to maintain oxygen delivery in partially occluded or diseased coronary arteries. studies to demonstrate how anaemia affects contractile function of the left ventricle have rarely shown important effects above haemoglobin concentrations of 70 g l. indeed it is more important to address the underlying pathophysiological causes of the acute coronary syndrome with proven therapy such as aspirin and β-blockers rather than treating mild-to-moderate anaemia as an initial step. if the effects of rbc transfusion were either limited or increased then there would be no debate however the use of allogeneic rbcs has been shown to be associated with immunomodulation 12 47 and or alteration in the delivery of oxygen in the microcirculation 70 71 resulting in increased rates of infections and organ failure. few clinical studies have attempted to elucidate the risk benefit ratio of anaemia and transfusion in cardiac patients. two small rcts 62 72 examined transfusion practice in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and concluded that a conservative approach to the administration of rbcs may be safe. however two recent cohort studies suggested that anaemia may increase the risk of mortality in critical illness 73 and following surgery in patients with cardiovascular disease 74 . in a study of jehovah's witnesses a group that refuses rbc transfusion on religious grounds undergoing surgical procedures 74 it was noted that mortality was significantly increased in patients with cardiac disease after a decrease in haemoglobin levels from 100-110 g l to 60-69 g l. in that study patients with no cardiac disease and similar changes in haemoglobin levels showed no increase in mortality which is in accordance with the results of the tricc trial 10 . in the study by hébert et al. 73 of 4470 critically ill patients a correlation between anaemia and mortality rates was observed. those investigators also found that the risk of anaemia appeared to decrease with rbc transfusion in patients with cardiac disease. in patients with cardiac disease mortality increased when haemoglobin concentrations were below 95 g l as compared with anaemic patients with other diagnoses 55 versus 42 p 0.09 . in the subgroup of patients with cardiac disease increasing haemoglobin values in anaemic patients was associated with improved survival odds ratio 0.80 for each 10 g l increase p 0.012 . one possible explanation for the discrepancy between the tricc trial and this observational study may be that the attending physicians who recruited patients into the study did not enter those patients who were considered to have severe cardiac disease. hébert et al. 73 sought to examine further whether a restrictive transfusion strategy was at least as effective as a liberal strategy in critically ill patients with cardiac disease. in the subgroup of patients with cardiovascular disease from the tricc trial those investigators suggested that most haemodynamically stable critically ill patients with cardiovascular disease may be transfused when haemoglobin concentrations fall below 70 g l and that the hemoglobin concentration should be maintained between 70 and 90 g l. average daily haemoglobin concentrations were 85 6.2 g l in the restrictive transfusion group and 103 6.7 g l in the liberal transfusion group p 0.01 . in the 357 patients with cardiovascular disease the 30-day mortality rate was 23 in the restrictive transfusion group versus 23 in the liberal group 95 confidence interval of the difference -8.4 to 9.1 p 1.00 . other mortality rates including 60-day 26 versus 27 p 0.90 icu 19 versus 16 p 0.49 and hospital mortality 27 versus 28 p 0.81 were not significantly different between groups. kaplan-meier survival curves comparing time to death demonstrated similar trends in the two groups fig. 3 p 0.98 . the multiple organ dysfunction mod scores during the entire study period were also not significantly different between groups 8.6 4.9 versus 9.0 4.4 p 0.40 but the change in mod score from baseline values was significantly lower in the restrictive group than in the liberal group 0.2 4.2 versus 1.3 4.4 p 0.02 . combined measures of morbidity and mortality or composite outcomes were also examined. when all patients who died were given a score of 24 the total mod score between groups was not different p 0.39 or were the changes in mod scores significantly different from baseline 2.7 6.9 versus 4.0 7.3 p 0.08 . among the specific subset of cardiac patients with ischaemic heart disease n 257 there were no discernible differences in 30-day and 60-day as well as icu mortality rates. however a nonsignificant p 0.3 decrease in overall survival rate in the restrictive group was noted in those patients with confirmed ischaemic heart disease severe peripheral vascular disease or severe comorbid cardiac disease fig. 4 . in conclusion a restrictive rbc transfusion strategy generally appears to be safe in most critically ill patients with cardiovascular disease with the possible exception of patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina. the need to reduce the amount of allogeneic blood transfusions in order to reduce the associated risks has been firmly established. rbcs are associated with clinically important immune suppression and stored rbcs have been shown to cause adverse microcirculatory effects that result in increased organ failure. the question for some time has been whether critically ill patients are able to tolerate lower levels of haemoglobin without deleterious effects thus reducing the amount of exposure to allogeneic transfusions. in the only large rct hébert et al 10 established that there was no difference in mortality rates between restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies in noncardiac critically ill patients. although those investigators were able to show convincing trends that the liberal strategy may in fact be deleterious in terms of absolute values statistical significance was not achieved. however the fact that no difference between the two strategies was achieved is of great importance because this means that the total number of transfusions can be reduced by approximately half without any impact on mortality. in addition these findings are easily put into clinical practice. although many questions remain the tricc trial and many laboratory and clinical studies have established that transfusing to normal haemoglobin concentrations does not improve organ failure and mortality in the critically ill patient. as such a restrictive transfusion strategy will reduce exposure to allogeneic transfusions result in more efficient use of rbcs save blood overall and decrease health care costs. icu intensive care unit mod multiple organ dysfunction rbc red blood cell rct randomized

resulting in increased risk of infection and microcirculatory injury from poorly deformable rbcs. it is the aim of the present commentary to justify the statement 'transfusing to normal haemoglobin

mortality and other clinically important outcomes in a critical care setting. we first explore the reasons why a reduction in the total number of allogeneic blood transfusions would be beneficial. second we examine the current evidence for using a lower transfusion strategy specifically that employed in the transfusion requirements in critical care tricc trial. rbc transfusions have inherent risks that may be categorized as follows 11 12 13 14 15 transfusion-transmitted infections immune-related reactions acute or delayed haemolytic reactions febrile allergic anaphylactic reactions and graft-versus-host disease and nonimmune-related reactions fluid overload hypothermia electrolyte toxicity and iron overload . major improvements in donor screening procedures and laboratory testing have dramatically improved the safety of the blood supply 16 . currently the risk of transmitting an infectious agent through blood transfusion ranges from 1 100 000 for hepatitis b virus to 1 1 000 000 for hiv canadian blood services personal communication 2000 . the most important threats to the blood supply remain new and unknown pathogens. more recently concern has focused on the potential transmission of prions through rbcs. also infectious agents with long latency periods pose particular risks to young individuals who require rbcs such as multiple trauma victims. the risk benefit ratio for a 24-year-old trauma victim with a 50-year life expectancy differs markedly from that for a person aged 80 years who is undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. in summary because there is a risk of transmitting diseases through the blood supply we should always strive to use rbcs according to the best available evidence in order to ensure that we do more good than harm to our patients. it is a long-standing observation 17 18 19 20 21 that blood transfusions are associated with immune suppression. this clinical phenomenon was first observed in renal transplant patients who had received blood transfusions while on dialysis before the transplant 22 and has been observed repeatedly in transplant centres around the world 23 24 . recently opelz et al 25 reported a multicentre clinical trial in which all renal allograft recipients received modern immunosuppressive regimens. those patients who were allocated to receive three allogeneic rbc units before renal transplant had a 1-year graft survival rate of 90 as compared with 82 for patients who were not transfused p 0.02 . these data suggest that there are long-term immunosuppressive effects following transfusion of non-leukocyte-reduced allogeneic rbcs. a large number of studies 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 have also suggested that allogeneic transfusions accelerate cancer growth perhaps due to altered immune surveillance. these altered immune responses after allogeneic rbc transfusions may also predispose critically ill transfusion recipients to nosocomial infections 35 36 37 38 39 40 and increased rates of multiple-system organ failure 41 which may ultimately result in higher mortality rates. however most studies that examined the association between cancer recurrence and postoperative infection after transfusion 42 43 only provided weak causal inferences because of poor study design and the lack of independence between allogeneic rbc transfusions and the potential complication. a recent meta-analysis 44 combined the results from seven rcts and was unable to detect clinically important decreases in mortality and postoperative infections. we added the results of a new rct by van de watering et al 45 to the above meta-analysis. the relative risk for all-cause mortality was 1.05 95 confidence interval 0.88-1.25 and was 1.10 95 confidence interval 0.85-1.43 for postoperative infections. however this meta-analysis excluded two positive rcts 40 46 because of the significant statistical heterogeneity introduced by these two studies. if all available rcts are combined ignoring heterogeneity then the relative risk difference for postoperative infections across all studies is 1.60 95 confidence interval 1.00-2.56 p 0.05 . thus the available evidence suggests that universal prestorage leukoreduction could have clinical effects that range from none to decreasing rates of infection by as much as 50 in high-risk patients. in summary despite convincing laboratory evidence and some supportive clinical studies the clinical significance of the immunosup-pressive effects of allogeneic rbc transfusions have not been clearly established 47 . more importantly the impact of a leukoreduction programme has not been studied in a large population of patients who are expected to have significant exposure to allogeneic rbcs. the majority of complications from allogeneic rbc transfusion however are no more frequent in the intensive care setting than in other patient populations with the possible exception of pulmonary oedema hypothermia and electrolyte disturbance. hypothermia and electrolyte disturbances occur most frequently with massive transfusions. in critically ill patients the optimal effective circulatory volume may be difficult to determine and as a consequence pulmonary oedema may be a much more frequent complication of rbc transfusion than in other patient populations. this may explain the significantly higher rate of pulmonary oedema in patients transfused using a threshold of 100 g l 5.3 in the restrictive transfusion group versus 10.7 in the liberal transfusion group p 0.01 as reported in the tricc trial 10 . as an alternative explanation the more frequent use of rbcs might have resulted in more frequent episodes of transfusion-related acute lung injury in the liberal strategy group 7.7 in the restrictive strategy versus 11.4 in the liberal strategy p 0.06 as reported in the tricc trial. clinical evidence is also insufficient to definitively establish a correlation between the age of rbcs being transfused and patient mortality however laboratory evidence has shown many storage-related changes that may result in impairment of blood flow and oxygen delivery at the microcirculatory level. marik et al 48 demonstrated an association between a fall in gastric intramucosal ph and transfusion of rbcs stored for longer than 15 days. in addition there is ample laboratory evidence that prolonged rbc storage adversely affects rbcs potentially results in the generation of cytokines and alters host immune function. in another study fitzgerald et al 49 using an animal model of transfusion consistently observed a lack of efficacy of transfused stored rat blood to improve tissue oxygen consumption as compared with fresh cells or other blood substitutes. three retrospective clinical studies tested the association between the age of transfused blood and duration of stay in the intensive care unit icu 50 and mortality 51 52 . martin et al 50 observed a statistically significant association between the transfusion of aged blood 14 days old and increased duration of icu stay p 0.003 in 698 critically ill patients. in patients who received a transfusion aged rbcs was the only predictor of duration of stay p 0.0001 . in survivors only median age of blood was predictive of duration of stay p 0.0001 . purdy et al 51 demonstrated a negative correlation r -0.73 between the proportion of rbc units of a given age transfused to survivors and increasing age of rbcs in patients admitted to the icu with a diagnosis of severe sepsis n 31 . those investigators also noted that these latter units were more likely to be older. a recently reported study by vamvakas and carven 52 evaluated the effect of duration of rbc storage on postoperative pneumonia in 416 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. those investigators noted an adjusted increase of 1 in the risk of postoperative pneumonia per day of average increase in the duration of rbc storage p 0.005 in transfused patients. each of these three studies also noted that patients who received a large number of rbc units had a higher mortality. although these risks are relatively small when viewed collectively they become significant when one considers that 25 of all critically ill patients in canada are transfused during their icu stay 1 . until recently physicians have depended on clinical judgement when deciding at what haemoglobin level to transfuse a critically ill patient. as a result significant variation has been shown to exist in transfusion practice among canadian critical care physicians 53 which is due largely to a lack of published data on the subject. an arbitrary haemoglobin level of 100 g l has historically been used as a threshold to transfuse critically ill patients. six observational studies investigated the importance of anaemia on transfusion practices in various settings. of these three large cohort studies which were performed in different patient populations intensive care 1 coronary artery bypass surgery 54 and hip fractures 55 reached different conclusions. rbc transfusions in particular improved outcome in critically ill patients with cardiovascular disease but increased the risk of myocardial infarction in coronary artery bypass surgery patients. transfusion had no impact on short-term or long-term mortality in hip-fracture patients. three smaller studies 56 57 58 evaluated the relationship between anaemia and adverse outcomes in vascular disease patients. although increased numbers of ischaemic events were observed in anaemic patients the validity of these studies is uncertain given that the decision to transfuse a patient was often correlated with illness burden of the patient. it is also possible that comorbidity was not adequately adjusted for in those studies. transfusion thresholds were compared in 10 randomized clinical trials 10 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 . although the clinical settings varied each trial randomized patients to be transfused on the basis of a 'conservative' or a 'liberal' strategy. the definitions of conservative and liberal strategies varied and actually overlapped between studies. of these 10 trials only three included more than 100 patients and only one trial evaluated the impact of transfusion on symptoms. in the first trial of patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass

arthroplasty were randomly assigned to receive autologous blood transfusion immediately after surgery or to receive autologous blood if haemoglobin level fell below 9 g dl 67 . again no differences in outcome were observed. the third trial of hip fracture patients undergoing surgical repair 64 found no differences in outcomes however five deaths were recorded at 60 days after surgery in the symptomatic group and two deaths occurred in the 10 g dl group. the numbers of patients in these trials were too small to evaluate the effect of lower transfusion triggers on clinically important outcomes such as mortality morbidity and functional status. in 1999 hebert et al 10 reported the results of the tricc trial. patients n 838 were randomized either to a restrictive strategy haemoglobin concentration maintained between 70 and 90 g l with a trigger set at 70 g l or to a liberal strategy haemoglobin concentration maintained between 100 and 120 g l with a trigger at 100 g l . to date the tricc trial is the only large study that has investigated these parameters. the groups were comparable at baseline. the average daily haemoglobin concentration ranged from 85 7.2 g l in the restrictive group to 107 7.3 g l in the liberal group p 0.01 . the average number of transfusions was reduced by 52 in the restrictive group 2.6 4.1 versus 5.6 5.3 rbcs patient p 0.01 . cardiac events primarily pulmonary oedema and myocardial infarction were more frequent in the liberal strategy p 0.01 table 1 . on examination of composite outcomes the number of patients with multiorgan failure was found to be substantially increased in both groups with the results being marginally better in the restrictive strategy group 20.6 versus 26.0 p 0.07 table 2 . overall the restrictive transfusion group showed a lower 30-day mortality 18.7 versus 23.3 p 0.11 fig. 1 . kaplan-meier survival curves however were significantly different in the subgroup of patients with an acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score of 20 or less p 0.02 fig. 2 . in addition although 60-day mortality 22.8 versus 26.5 p 0.23 and icu mortality 13.9 versus 16.2 p 0.29 were not statistically significant they did show a consistent trend in terms of absolute values that favoured the restrictive strategy. the key observation from the tricc trial is not that the restrictive strategy is better but rather that it is at worst equivalent to the liberal strategy and at best superior to the liberal strategy. at this juncture preclinical and clinical evidence support the adoption of a more restrictive transfusion strategy in most critically ill patients. however there remain divergent views regarding the risks and benefits of treating anaemia in patients with cardiovascular disease. laboratory-based studies 68 69 suggest that patients with cardiovascular disease may require higher haemoglobin concentrations to maintain oxygen delivery in partially occluded or diseased coronary arteries. studies to demonstrate how anaemia affects contractile function of the left ventricle have rarely shown important effects above haemoglobin concentrations of 70 g l. indeed it is more important to address the underlying pathophysiological causes of the acute coronary syndrome with proven therapy such as aspirin and β-blockers rather than treating mild-to-moderate anaemia as an initial step. if the effects of rbc transfusion were either limited or increased then there would be no debate however the use of allogeneic rbcs has been shown to be associated with immunomodulation 12 47 and or alteration in the delivery of oxygen in the microcirculation 70 71 resulting in increased rates of infections and organ failure. few clinical studies have attempted to elucidate the risk benefit ratio of anaemia and transfusion in cardiac patients. two small rcts 62 72 examined transfusion practice in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and concluded that a conservative approach to the administration of rbcs may be safe. however two recent cohort studies suggested that anaemia may increase the risk of mortality in critical illness 73 and following surgery in patients with cardiovascular disease 74 . in a study of jehovah's witnesses a group that refuses rbc transfusion on religious grounds undergoing surgical procedures 74 it was noted that mortality was significantly increased in patients with cardiac disease after a decrease in haemoglobin levels from 100-110 g l to 60-69 g l. in that study patients with no cardiac disease and similar changes in haemoglobin levels showed no increase in mortality which is in accordance with the results of the tricc trial 10 . in the study by hébert et al. 73 of 4470 critically ill patients a correlation between anaemia and mortality rates was observed. those investigators also found that the risk of anaemia appeared to decrease with rbc transfusion in patients with cardiac disease. in patients with cardiac disease mortality increased when haemoglobin concentrations were below 95 g l as compared with anaemic patients with other diagnoses 55 versus 42 p 0.09 . in the subgroup of patients with cardiac disease increasing haemoglobin values in anaemic patients was associated with improved survival odds ratio 0.80 for each 10 g l increase p 0.012 . one possible explanation for the discrepancy between the tricc trial and this observational study may be that the attending physicians who recruited patients into the study did not enter those patients who were considered to have severe cardiac disease. hébert et al. 73 sought to examine further whether a restrictive transfusion strategy was at least as effective as a liberal strategy in critically ill patients with cardiac disease. in the subgroup of patients with cardiovascular disease from the tricc trial those investigators suggested that most haemodynamically stable critically ill patients with cardiovascular disease may be transfused when haemoglobin concentrations fall below 70 g l and that the hemoglobin concentration should be maintained between 70 and 90 g l. average daily haemoglobin concentrations were 85 6.2 g l in the restrictive transfusion group and 103 6.7 g l in the liberal transfusion group p 0.01 . in the 357 patients with cardiovascular disease the 30-day mortality rate was 23 in the restrictive transfusion group versus 23 in the liberal group 95 confidence interval of the difference -8.4 to 9.1 p 1.00 . other mortality rates including 60-day 26 versus 27 p 0.90 icu 19 versus 16 p 0.49 and hospital mortality 27 versus 28 p 0.81 were not significantly different between groups. kaplan-meier survival curves comparing time to death demonstrated similar trends in the two groups fig. 3 p 0.98 . the multiple organ dysfunction mod scores during the entire study period were also not significantly different between groups 8.6 4.9 versus 9.0 4.4 p 0.40 but the change in mod score from baseline values was significantly lower in the restrictive group than in the liberal group 0.2 4.2 versus 1.3 4.4 p 0.02 . combined measures of morbidity and mortality or composite outcomes were also examined. when all patients who died were given a score of 24 the total mod score between groups was not different p 0.39 or were the changes in mod scores significantly different from baseline 2.7 6.9 versus 4.0 7.3 p 0.08 . among the specific subset of cardiac patients with ischaemic heart disease n 257 there were no discernible differences in 30-day and 60-day as well as icu mortality rates. however a nonsignificant p 0.3 decrease in overall survival rate in the restrictive group was noted in those patients with confirmed ischaemic heart disease severe peripheral vascular disease or severe comorbid cardiac disease fig. 4 . in conclusion a restrictive rbc transfusion strategy generally appears to be safe in most critically ill patients with cardiovascular disease with the possible exception of patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina. the need to reduce the amount of allogeneic blood transfusions in order to reduce the associated risks has been firmly established. rbcs are associated with clinically important immune suppression and stored rbcs have been shown to cause adverse microcirculatory effects that result in increased organ failure. the question for some time has been whether critically ill patients are able to tolerate lower levels of haemoglobin without deleterious effects thus reducing the amount of exposure to allogeneic transfusions. in the only large rct hébert et al 10 established that there was no difference in mortality rates between restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies in noncardiac critically ill patients. although those investigators were able to show convincing trends that the liberal strategy may in fact be deleterious in terms of absolute values statistical significance was not achieved. however the fact that no difference between the two strategies was achieved is of great importance because this means that the total number of transfusions can be reduced by approximately half without any impact on mortality. in addition these findings are easily put into clinical practice. although many questions remain the tricc trial and many laboratory and clinical studies have established that transfusing to normal haemoglobin concentrations does not improve organ failure and mortality in the critically ill patient. as such a restrictive transfusion strategy will reduce exposure to allogeneic transfusions result in more efficient use of rbcs save blood overall and decrease health care costs. icu intensive care unit mod multiple organ dysfunction rbc red blood cell rct randomized

the art' lectures pro con debates seminars and tutorials were of a high standard. the meeting was marked by a sense of renewed enthusiasm that positive progress is occurring in intensive care medicine.\", 'body': \"this year's symposium was dominated by the results of recent clinical trials. after 10 years of 'magic bullet' trials in sepsis a number of successful therapeutic options are now emerging. in addition recent advances in our understanding of the soup of mediators observed in sepsis offer yet more tantalizing targets for new therapies. in contrast the eagerly awaited results from italy of the prone positioning trial in ards were disheartening. the epidemiology of both sepsis and ards and their impact on clinical studies and the future provision of critical care were also hot topics. the era of extracorporeal liver replacement therapy is upon us with considerable early promise and the probability of wide availability. finally as always ethics remained an area of interest. this report summarizes and discusses the presentations on the above topics. angus pittsburgh pa usa presented his group's work on the epidemiology of sepsis in the usa accepted for publication in critical care medicine . they developed a method for identifying hospitalized patients with sepsis based on icd9 criteria the most widely recorded coding system used in us hospitals. prospective testing of the method found it to be both sensitive and reliable. they then applied it to a representative selection of us hospitals. their results indicated that about 50 of intensive care unit icu patients have systemic inflammatory response syndrome and that approximately 20 of these progress to severe sepsis. mortality for severe sepsis was greater than 30 . demographically those at the extremes of age represent the most at-risk groups in whom the mortality is also the highest. these data provides yet another reminder that the increasing demands on health care resources caused by the ageing population is predicted to exceed intensive care provision within the next 10-20 years. finally those investigators found a striking demographic peak in patients aged 20-30 years which they attributed largely to human immunodeficiency virus. the long-standing debate between the two schools of sepsis theory - microcirculatory dys-autoregulation versus cellular dysfunction - shows signs of resolution. new techniques for studying tissue oxygen tension presented by ince amsterdam the netherlands provide more evidence that microcirculatory dys-autoregulation results in significant shunting. this occurs predominantly in the submucosal and serosal portions of organs and is an early event. these studies show that the macroscopic restoration of global oxygen delivery fails to improve oxygen consumption as the mucosa becomes hyperoxic whereas the submucosa and serosa remain hypoxic. somewhat counterintuitively this can be reversed in the face of resistant hypotension with vasodilators at least in animal models. the cellular dysfunction camp although still somewhat doubtful as to the importance of these microcirculatory findings have now clearly established that their championed mechanism of mitochondrial failure is a late but crucial event in the evolution of sepsis. fink pittsburgh pa usa presented evidence that mitochondrial failure in septic cells is triggered by the activation of the enzyme poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase 1 . this enzyme represents a significant target for novel therapies which are apparently already in development. the debate regarding the toxicity of oxygen and the formation of free radicals continues despite the absence of demonstrated effectiveness of scavenging therapies and is a testament to the incomplete understanding of this area. the round-table conference preceding this year's symposium concentrated on distilling current knowledge on the microscopic events in critically ill patients into an explanation of the macroscopic multiorgan failure that is so commonly encountered. the conclusions of the conference appeared to relate mostly to future directions for research in particular the study of organ-organ interactions. marshall toronto canada proposed the development of an alternative to the much-maligned physiological scoring systems based on the staging systems widely used in the field of oncology. he proposed that mediator levels in addition to physiological variables will soon be used usefully to characterize septic patients. he also suggested that in the light of the recent successful mediator trials in sepsis future therapies will be directed in a manner analogous to the control of glucose in diabetic patients. the natural anticoagulants antithrombin iii at iii tissue factor pathway inhibitor tfpi and activated protein c apc and the cytokine tumour necrosis factor tnf -α are the latest inflammatory mediators to be targeted in large multicentre clinical trials in an attempt to improve the current dismal outcome for patients with severe sepsis. the kybersept at iii study recruited over 2300 patients from 200 centres with high simplified acute physiology scale scores median 50 and a mortality of nearly 40 2 . unfortunately no overall benefit was shown between at iii and placebo although results were more encouraging in an analysis of the subgroup of patients who received at iii but no heparin which is known to inhibit at iii. interestingly improvements in quality of life scores were seen in survivors who received at iii in comparison to those who received placebo suggesting that morbidity may be reduced although again this was an analysis of a subgroup. patients in the at iii group who received concomitant heparin had a significantly higher incidence of bleeding events and outcome worsened as the dose of heparin increased. explanations for the failure of this study included the inhibitory effects of heparin and the failure to achieve at iii activity levels of greater that 200 from baseline in the treatment population a level established as required for therapeutic benefit in phase ii trials. phase ii clinical trial results using tfpi tfpi n 141 placebo n 69 unpublished data show a mortality benefit in the sicker sepsis patients who already have coagulation problems. results of the phase iii multicentre study are expected to be presented at the 22nd international symposium on intensive care and emergency medicine in brussels in 2002. human trials of various anti-tnf-α formulations have been variable to date and include north american sepsis trial norasept i 3 international sepsis trial intersept 4 and norasept ii 5 . possible reasons have included a lack of biological activity of the anti-tnf-α formulation studied inappropriate timing of therapy redundancy of proinflammatory mediators and hetereogeneity of patient populations. the monoclonal anti-tnf a randomized controlled sepsis trial monarcs study used a different anti-tnf-α formulation f ab' 2 fragment of a murine monoclonal antibody to human tnf-α and stratified patients based on demonstrable abnormalities in immunological pathways highly elevated interleukin-6 levels - a circulating cytokine that is induced by tnf-α . unpublished results revealed 28-day mortality rates of 44 and 48 in the anti-tnf-α and placebo groups respectively in those patients who had high interleukin-6 levels on recruitment to the study n 488 anti-tnf-α n 510 placebo . this represented a relative mortality reduction of 14 . relative mortality reduction in all patients n 1305 anti-tnf-α n 1329 placebo independent of baseline interleukin-6 levels was only 10 . the recombinant human activated protein c worldwide evaluation in severe sepsis prowess study is hot off the press 6 and presentation of the results at the congress allowed those of us who still carry the unopened new england journal of medicine issue in our briefcases to catch up a total of 164 sites from 11 countries recruited 1690 patients with severe sepsis before the trial was prematurely stopped following the second safety analysis. twenty-eight-day all-cause mortality rates for placebo and apc were 31 and 25 respectively with a relative risk reduction of 19 . resolution of cardiovascular and respiratory function was more rapid in survivors who received apc although icu and hospital stay did not differ. there was a trend towards an increase in serious bleeding events in the apc group 3 apc versus 2 placebo but these events were primarily due to trauma or instrumentation. although this is an exciting breakthrough we all recognize that when apc reaches the market place it will seriously stretch icu finances especially because there appear to be other mediators on the horizon that we will be encouraged to use in combination to fight the inflammatory 'soup'. two opposing epidemiological views of ards were presented by lemaire créteil france and evans london uk . broad agreement does seem to exist as to the incidence of this condition which is in the order of 10 100 000 although there is significant variation between countries. it was argued that this variation results from the availability of ventilated beds with higher incidences apparent in countries with greater provision emphasizing that this condition can be considered the result of intensive care intervention or as one speaker put it 'physician-induced lung injury'. early results from the acute lung injury verification of european epidemiology alive study unpublished data sponsored by the european society of intensive care medicine are at odds with recent trial findings. the alive study which included over 6000 patients surveyed in 1998 found a 50-60 28-day mortality which compares to only 20-30 in the control groups of recent trials. pneumonia was the commonest cause responsible for 50 of cases with sepsis identified as the cause in a further 20-30 . astonishingly this study found the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fractional inspired oxygen at icu admission was highly predictive of mortality despite continuing controversy regarding this measurement. a diverse range of views were presented from the third international consensus conference on ards unpublished data held in barcelona late last year. the decision as to how to change the defining criteria for this condition remains unresolved. the debates surrounding chest x-ray criteria the use of the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fractional inspired oxygen and the level utility of pulmonary artery wedge pressure measurements continue. in addition a debate has arisen as to whether ards can be a unilateral process and whether it can coexist with cardiac failure. there appears to be increasing recognition that ards represents only a small subset of patients with acute lung failure approximately 30 . surprisingly little is known about the remainder of this larger group. in contrast to the alive study several centres have reported their 28-day mortality at 40 which represents an improvement from the 60 of 10 years ago. however it was argued that a 28-day follow-up period is too short for clinical trials as the long-term quality of life for patients with ards is poor compared with that of critically ill patients without this condition. results suggest that the recovery of lung function is good overall but is dependent on severity. treatment recommendations include the universal adoption of the us national institutes of health protective lung ventilation strategy 7 . there was general agreement that recruitment manoeuvres are beneficial but how and when to employ them remains controversial. rouby paris france put forward a new classification for ards based on computed tomography findings. he observed that patients can be split into three groups depending on the appearance of the upper lobes. in group 1 the upper lobes are normal and positive end-expiratory pressure peep is of little benefit and results in significant over-distension. survival in this group is approximately 60 . in group 2 the upper lobes are abnormal peep is of dramatic benefit but survival is only approximately 25 . in group 3 there are mixed patchy abnormalities the effects of peep are less predictable but as in group 1 survival is approximately 60 . gattinoni milan italy presented the results of the long-awaited italian multicentre randomized controlled trial of prone positioning in ards unpublished data . this trial was terminated after 3 years despite having only recruited 304 patients enrollment of 750 patients was originally planned in order to achieve sufficient statistical power. at trial outset recruitment was encumbered by the lack of familiarity with and scepticism regarding this procedure in many of the centres. however by the end of the study many participants were unwilling to enter patients into the trial because they felt it unethical to deny them this intervention. the trial protocol resulted in patients in the treatment group being prone for an average of only 7 out of 24 h for a 10-day period. overall there was no difference in mortality between the control and treatment groups at day 10 time of icu discharge or at 6 months. interestingly analysis of subgroups revealed a significant difference in the outcome at 10 days for patients with the most severe disease although this disappeared by icu discharge. in retrospect the design of this ambitious trial was flawed by its failure to establish the optimal utilization of this manoeuvre. the opening session reported that we are making progress in supporting the failing liver wendon london uk . current optimism should probably be limited to extra-corporeal methods because the molecular adsorbent recirculating system essentially extracorporeal albumin dialysis has been shown to have beneficial clinical effects as well as improved survival in two small randomized controlled trials 8 9 . the equipment is familiar to all those who use dialytic therapies and we will undoubtedly hear more about this system in the next few years. the slide of a patient reading the newspaper through a transparent helmet while receiving noninvasive ventilation niv resembled pictures of a nasa astronaut however it was reported to be well tolerated for prolonged periods and significantly reduces the complications associated with niv pressure areas tolerance of mask . the recent consensus conference 10 examined weaning aspects of niv and emphasized the reduced weaning time and avoidance of reintubation but called for more randomized controlled trials. finally although continuous positive airway pressure has been shown to be beneficial in pulmonary oedema caution is still advised with the use of bilevel positive airway pressure because of the reporting of myocardial infarction in several studies. however the groups studied were unmatched and starting points were different so conclusions should not be drawn until randomized controlled trial results are available in this area. this was a well-attended session which according to levy providence ri usa was in complete contrast to the interest shown in the usa for the subject. although there were few new data in the session the emphasis on a strategy for lawsuits was welcome. suggestions included statements from scientific societies at a national and international level open reporting in medical files of decisions to withdraw or withhold treatment and family involvement in decision making that will ultimately involve better media education. the last day of this year's symposium was sadly abandoned by many due to the belgian rail strike. despite this the usual convivial atmosphere both in and around the congress was as abundant as ever. overall the 'state of the art' lectures pro con debates seminars and tutorials were of the usual high standard although yet again access to many of the symposium's venues was limited by the lack of capacity of the secondary rooms. the 21st international symposium was marked by a sense of renewed enthusiasm

emergency medicine brussels belgium 20-23 march 2001 the 21st international symposium on intensive care and emergency medicine was dominated by the results of recent clinical trials in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards . the promise of extracorporeal liver replacement therapy and noninvasive ventilation were other areas of interest. ethical issues also received attention. overall the 'state of the art' lectures pro con debates seminars and tutorials were of a high standard. the meeting was marked by a sense of renewed enthusiasm that positive progress is occurring in intensive care medicine. this year's symposium was dominated by the results of recent clinical trials. after 10 years of 'magic bullet' trials in sepsis a number of successful therapeutic options are now emerging. in addition recent advances in our understanding of the soup of mediators observed in sepsis offer yet more tantalizing targets for new therapies. in contrast the eagerly awaited results from italy of the prone positioning trial in ards were disheartening. the epidemiology of both sepsis and ards and their impact on clinical studies and the future provision of critical care were also hot topics. the era of extracorporeal liver replacement therapy is upon us with considerable early promise and the probability of wide availability. finally as always ethics remained an area of interest. this report summarizes and discusses the presentations on the above topics. angus pittsburgh pa usa presented his group's work on the epidemiology of sepsis in the usa accepted for publication in critical care medicine . they developed a method for identifying hospitalized patients with sepsis based on icd9 criteria the most widely recorded coding system used in us hospitals. prospective testing of the method found it to be both sensitive and reliable. they then applied it to a representative selection of us hospitals. their results indicated that about 50 of intensive care unit icu patients have systemic inflammatory response syndrome and that approximately 20 of these progress to severe sepsis. mortality for severe sepsis was greater than 30 . demographically those at the extremes of age represent the most at-risk groups in whom the mortality is also the highest. these data provides yet another reminder that the increasing demands on health care resources caused by the ageing population is predicted to exceed intensive care provision within the next 10-20 years. finally those investigators found a striking demographic peak in patients aged 20-30 years which they attributed largely to human immunodeficiency virus. the long-standing debate between the two schools of sepsis theory - microcirculatory dys-autoregulation versus cellular dysfunction - shows signs of resolution. new techniques for studying tissue oxygen tension presented by ince amsterdam the netherlands provide more evidence that microcirculatory dys-autoregulation results in significant shunting. this occurs predominantly in the submucosal and serosal portions of organs and is an early event. these studies show that the macroscopic restoration of global oxygen delivery fails to improve oxygen consumption as the mucosa becomes hyperoxic whereas the submucosa and serosa remain hypoxic. somewhat counterintuitively this can be reversed in the face of resistant hypotension with vasodilators at least in animal models. the cellular dysfunction camp although still somewhat doubtful as to the importance of these microcirculatory findings have now clearly established that their championed mechanism of mitochondrial failure is a late but crucial event in the evolution of sepsis. fink pittsburgh pa usa presented evidence that mitochondrial failure in septic cells is triggered by the activation of the enzyme poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase 1 . this enzyme represents a significant target for novel therapies which are apparently already in development. the debate regarding the toxicity of oxygen and the formation of free radicals continues despite the absence of demonstrated effectiveness of scavenging therapies and is a testament to the incomplete understanding of this area. the round-table conference preceding this year's symposium concentrated on distilling current knowledge on the microscopic events in critically ill patients into an explanation of the macroscopic multiorgan failure that is so commonly encountered. the conclusions of the conference appeared to relate mostly to future directions for research in particular the study of organ-organ interactions. marshall toronto canada proposed the development of an alternative to the much-maligned physiological scoring systems based on the staging systems widely used in the field of oncology. he proposed that mediator levels in addition to physiological variables will soon be used usefully to characterize septic patients. he also suggested that in the light of the recent successful mediator trials in sepsis future therapies will be directed in a manner analogous to the control of glucose in diabetic patients. the natural anticoagulants antithrombin iii at iii tissue factor pathway inhibitor tfpi and activated protein c apc and the cytokine tumour necrosis factor tnf -α are the latest inflammatory mediators to be targeted in large multicentre clinical trials in an attempt to improve the current dismal outcome for patients with severe sepsis. the kybersept at iii study recruited over 2300 patients from 200 centres with high simplified acute physiology scale scores median 50 and a mortality of nearly 40 2 . unfortunately no overall benefit was shown between at iii and placebo although results were more encouraging in an analysis of the subgroup of patients who received at iii but no heparin which is known to inhibit at iii. interestingly improvements in quality of life scores were seen in survivors who received at iii in comparison to those who received placebo suggesting that morbidity may be reduced although again this was an analysis of a subgroup. patients in the at iii group who received concomitant heparin had a significantly higher incidence of bleeding events and outcome worsened as the dose of heparin increased. explanations for the failure of this study included the inhibitory effects of heparin and the failure to achieve at iii activity levels of greater that 200 from baseline in the treatment population a level established as required for therapeutic benefit in phase ii trials. phase ii clinical trial results using tfpi tfpi n 141 placebo n 69 unpublished data show a mortality benefit in the sicker sepsis patients who already have coagulation problems. results of the phase iii multicentre study are expected to be presented at the 22nd international symposium on intensive care and emergency medicine in brussels in 2002. human trials of various anti-tnf-α formulations have been variable to date and include north american sepsis trial norasept i 3 international sepsis trial intersept 4 and norasept ii 5 . possible reasons have included a lack of biological activity of the anti-tnf-α formulation studied inappropriate timing of therapy redundancy of proinflammatory mediators and hetereogeneity of patient populations. the monoclonal anti-tnf a randomized controlled sepsis trial monarcs study used a different anti-tnf-α formulation f ab' 2 fragment of a murine monoclonal antibody to human tnf-α and stratified patients based on demonstrable abnormalities in immunological pathways highly elevated interleukin-6 levels - a circulating cytokine that is induced by tnf-α . unpublished results revealed 28-day mortality rates of 44 and 48 in the anti-tnf-α and placebo groups respectively in those patients who had high interleukin-6 levels on recruitment to the study n 488 anti-tnf-α n 510 placebo . this represented a relative mortality reduction of 14 . relative mortality

confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. in addition to its physiological role in heme degradation ho-1 may influence a number of cellular processes including growth inflammation and apoptosis. by virtue of anti-inflammatory effects ho-1 limits tissue damage in response to proinflammatory stimuli and prevents allograft rejection after transplantation. the transcriptional upregulation of ho-1 responds to many agents such as hypoxia bacterial lipopolysaccharide and reactive oxygen nitrogen species. ho-1 and its constitutively expressed isozyme heme oxygenase-2 catalyze the rate-limiting step in the conversion of heme to its metabolites bilirubin ixα ferrous iron and carbon monoxide co . the mechanisms by which ho-1 provides protection most likely involve its enzymatic reaction products. remarkably administration of co at low concentrations can substitute for ho-1 with respect to anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects suggesting a role for co as a key mediator of ho-1 function. chronic low-level exogenous exposure to co from cigarette smoking contributes to the importance of co in pulmonary medicine. the implications of the ho-1 co system in pulmonary diseases will be discussed in this review with an emphasis on inflammatory states.', 'body': \"the heme oxygenase-1 carbon monoxide ho-1 co system has recently seen an explosion of research interest due to its newly discovered physiological effects. this metabolic pathway first characterized by tenhunen et al. 1 2 has only recently revealed its surprising cytoprotective properties 3 4 . research in ho-1 co now embraces the entire field of medicine where reactive oxygen nitrogen species inflammation growth control and apoptosis represent important pathophysiological mechanisms 3-6 . indeed the number of publications in recent years concerning ho-1 has increased exponentially while the list of diseases and physiological responses associated with changes in ho-1 continues to expand 5 . until now relatively few studies have addressed the role of ho-1 co in pulmonary medicine. several investigators have focused on the diagnostic application of the ho-1 co system by measuring exhaled co e-co in various pathological pulmonary conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd 7 . in another experimental approach investigators have examined the expression of ho-1 in lung tissue from healthy or diseased subjects 8 9 . this review will highlight the actions of ho-1 co in the context of pulmonary diseases fig. 1 emphasizing potential protective effects against inflammation allergic reactions oxidative stress endotoxin shock apoptosis and tumor cell growth 10-17 . heme oxygenase ho ec 1.14.99.3 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in heme degradation. in the ho reaction the oxidation of heme generates equimolar ferrous iron biliverdin ixα and co. nad p h biliverdin reductase subsequently converts bilverdin ixα into bilirubin ixα 1 . the bile pigments generated during heme degradation have antioxidant properties 18 19 . the liberated heme iron undergoes detoxification either by extracellular efflux or by sequestration into ferritin an intracellular iron-storage molecule with potential cytoprotective function 20-23 . of the three known isoforms of ho ho-1 ho-2 and ho-3 only ho-1 responds to xenobiotic induction 24-27 . constitutively expressed in many tissues ho-2 occurs at high levels in nervous and vascular tissues and may respond to regulation by glucocorticoids 25 28 29 . ho-1 and ho-2 differ in genetic origin in primary structure in molecular weight and in their substrate and kinetic parameters 25 26 . ho-3 displays a high sequence homology with ho-2 but has little enzymatic activity 27 . this review will focus on the inducible ho-1 form. in addition to the physiological substrate heme ho-1 responds to induction by a wide variety of stimuli associated with oxidative stress. such inducing agents include hypoxia hyperoxia cytokines nitric oxide no heavy metals ultraviolet-a 320 380 nm radiation heat shock shear stress hydrogen peroxide and thiol -sh -reactive substances 3 . the multiplicity of toxic inducers suggest that ho-1 may function as a critical cytoprotective molecule 3 4 . many studies have suggested that ho-1 acts as an inducible defense against oxidative stress in models of inflammation ischemia-reperfusion hypoxia and hyperoxia-mediated injury reviewed in 3 . the mechanisms by which ho-1 can mediate cytoprotection are still poorly understood. all three products of the ho reaction potentially participate in cellular defense of which the gaseous molecule co has recently received the most attention 30 31 . the administration of co at low concentrations can compensate for the protective effects of ho-1 in the presence of competitive inhibitors of ho-1 activity 32-34 . while ho-1 gene transfer confers protection against oxidative stress in a number of systems clearly not all studies support a beneficial role for ho-1 expression. cell-culture studies have suggested that the protective effects of ho-1 overexpression fall within a critical range such that the excess production of ho-1 or ho-2 may be counterprotective due to a transient excess of reactive iron generated during active heme metabolism 35 36 . thus an important caveat of comparative studies on the therapeutic effects of co administration versus ho-1 gene delivery arises from the fact that the latter approach in addition to producing co may have profound effects on intracellular iron metabolism. ho-1 expression is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level. genetic analyses have revealed two enhancer sequences e1 e2 in the murine ho-1 gene located at -4 kb e1 and -10 kbp e2 of the transcriptional start site 37 38 . these enhancers mediate the induction of ho-1 by many agents including heavy metals phorbol esters endotoxin oxidants and heme. e1 and e2 contain repeated stress-responsive elements which consist of overlapping binding sites for transcription factors including activator protein-1 ap-1 v-maf oncoprotein and the cap'n'collar basic-leucine zipper family of proteins cnc-bzip of which nrf2 nf-e2-related factor may play a critical role in ho-1 transcription 39 . the promoter region of ho-1 also contains potential binding sites for nuclear factor κb nf-κb though the functional significance of these are not clear 40 . both nf-κb and ap-1 have been identified as regulatory elements responsive to oxidative cellular stress 40 41 . in response to hyperoxic stress ap-1 factors mediated the induction of ho-1 in cooperation with signal-transducer and activator of transcription stat proteins 41 . furthermore a distinct hypoxia-response element hre which mediates the ho-1 response to hypoxia represents a binding site for the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 hif-1 42 . the toxic properties of co are well known in the field of pulmonary medicine. this invisible odorless gas still claims many victims each year by accidental exposure. co evolves from the combustion of organic materials and is present in smoke and automobile exhaust. the toxic actions of co relate to its high affinity for hemoglobin 240-fold greater than that of o2 . co replaces o2 rapidly from hemoglobin causing tissue hypoxia 43-45 . at high concentrations other mechanisms of co-induced toxicity may include apoptosis lipid peroxidation and inhibition of drug metabolism and respiratory enzyme functions 44 . only recently has it become known that at very low concentrations co participates in many physiological reactions. where a co exposure of 10 000 parts per million ppm 1 by volume co in air is toxic 100 250 ppm one hundredth to one fortieth as much will stimulate the physiological effects without apparent toxicity 4 . the majority of endogenous co production originates from active heme metabolism 86 though a portion may be produced in lipid peroxidation and drug metabolism reactions 46 . cigarette smoking still practiced by many lung patients represents a major source of chronic low-level exposure to co. inhaled co initially targets alveolar macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells. the exact mechanisms by which co acts at the molecular level remain incompletely understood. co potentially exerts its physiological effects by influencing at least three known pathways fig. 2 . by complexation with the heme moiety of the enzyme co activates soluble guanylate cyclase sgc stimulating the production of cyclic 3' 5'-guanosine monophosphate cgmp 47 . the sgc cgmp pathway mediates the effects of co on vascular relaxation smooth muscle cell relaxation bronchodilation neurotransmission and the inhibition of platelet aggregation coagulation and smooth muscle proliferation 48-51 . furthermore co may cause vascular relaxation by directly activating calcium-dependent potassium channels 52-54 . co potentially influences other intracellular signal transduction pathways. the mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk pathways which transduce oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling i.e. response to lipopolysaccharide may represent an important target of co action 32 34 55 56 . an anti-apoptotic effect of co and its relation to mapk has recently been described. the overexpression of ho-1 or the exogenous administration of co prevented tumor necrosis factor α tnf-α -induced apoptosis in murine fibroblasts 57 . in endothelial cells the anti-apoptotic effect of co depended on the modulation of the p38 38 kilodalton protein mapk pathway 34 . the role of the remaining heme metabolites i.e. fe and biliverdin ixα in the modulation of apoptosis is currently being investigated and is beyond the scope of this review. recent studies have reported a potent anti-inflammatory effect of co involving the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production after endotoxin stimulation dependent on the modulation of p38 mapk 32 . the clinical relevance of p38 mapk lies in the possibility of modulating this pathway in various clinical conditions to downregulate the inflammatory response 58 . oxidative stress arising from an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants plays a central role in the pathogenesis of airway disease 59 . in lung tissue ho-1 expression may occur in respiratory epithelial cells fibroblasts endothelial cells and to a large extent in alveolar macrophages 41 60 61 . ho-1 induction in these tissues in vitro and in vivo responds to common causes of oxidative stress to the airways including hyperoxia hypoxia endotoxemia heavy metal exposure bleomycin diesel exhaust particles and allergen exposure 4 41 61 . induction of ho-1 or administration of co can protect cells from these stressful stimuli 10 41 . in one of the experiments that best illustrate the protective role of co in vivo rats were exposed to hyperoxia 98 o2 in the absence or presence of co at low concentration 250 ppm . the co-treated rats showed increased survival and a diminished inflammatory response to the hyperoxia 11 . as demonstrated in a model of endotoxin-induced inflammation the protection afforded by co most likely resulted from the downregulated synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines i.e. tnf-α il-1β and the upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 il-10 32 . furthermore increases in exhaled co e-co have been reported in a number of pathological pulmonary conditions such as unstable asthma copd and infectious lung disease these increases may reflect increased endogenous ho-1 activity 7 . elevated carboxyhemoglobin hb-co levels have also been reported in these same diseases in nonsmoking subjects where both the e-co and hb-co levels decrease to normal levels in response to therapy 62 . e-co in humans originates primarily from both systemic heme metabolism which produces co in various tissues and localized lung heme metabolism as a result of the combined action of inducible ho-1 and constitutive ho-2 enzymatic activity. endogenously produced or inspired co is eliminated exclusively by respiration 63 . elevation of e-co may also reflect an increase in exogenous sources such as smoking or air pollution. in addition to changes in environmental factors elevations of e-co in lung diseases may reflect an increase in blood hb-co levels in response to systemic inflammation as well as an increase in pulmonary ho-1 expression in response to local inflammation 9 62 64 . the diagnostic value of measuring e-co remains controversial due to many conflicting reports i.e. some reports indicate differences in e-co measurements between disease activity and controls and some reports do not . the possible explanations for these discrepancies include large differences in patient populations and in the methods used for measuring e-co and undefined corrections for background levels of co. furthermore remarkable differences arise between studies in the magnitude of the e-co levels in the control groups as well as in treated or untreated asthma patients. when active or passive smoking occurs or in the presence of high background levels of co the measurement of e-co is not particularly useful for monitoring airway inflammation. in patients who smoke e-co can be used only to confirm the smoking habit 65 66 . comparable to the beginning era of measurements of exhaled no a standardization in techniques and agreement on background correction should be reached for e-co measurements to allow proper conclusions to be drawn in this area of investigation. asthma a form of allergic lung disease features an accumulation of inflammatory cells and mucus in the airways associated with bronchoconstriction and a generalized airflow limitation. inflammation a key component of asthma involves multiple cells and mediators where an imbalance in oxidants antioxidants contributes to cell damage. several pathways associated with oxidative stress may participate in asthma. for example the redox-sensitive transcription factors nf-κb and ap-1 control the expression of proinflammatory mediators 59 67-69 . in light of the potential protective effects of ho-1 co on inflammatory processes the study of ho-1 in asthma has gained popularity. in a mouse model of asthma ho-1 expression increased in lung tissue in response to ovalbumin aerosol challenge indicating a role for ho-1 in asthma 70 . in a similar model of aeroallergen-induced asthma in ovalbumin-sensitized mice exposure to a co atmosphere resulted in a marked attenuation of eosinophil content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf and downregulation of the proinflammatory cytokine il-5 10 . this experiment showed that exogenous co can inhibit asthmatic responses to allergens in mice. recent human studies have revealed higher ho-1 expression in the alveolar macrophages and higher e-co in untreated asthmatic patients than in healthy nonsmoking controls 71 72 . patients with exacerbations of asthma and patients who were withdrawn from inhaled steroids showed higher e-co levels than steroid-treated asthmatics or healthy controls 73 . higher levels of e-co may also occur in children with persistent asthma than in healthy controls 74 . e-co levels may correlate with functional parameters such as peak expiratory flow rate. a low rate in asthma exacerbations correlated with high e-co whereas normalization of the rate with oral glucocorticoid treatment resulted in a reduction of e-co 75 . furthermore increased e-co was associated with greater expression of ho-1 in airway alveolar macrophages obtained by induced sputum in untreated asthmatic patients than in controls. these asthma patients also showed higher bilirubin levels in the induced sputum indicating higher ho activity 71 . furthermore patients with asthma show an increased hb-co level at the time of exacerbation with values decreasing to control levels after oral glucocorticoid treatment 62 . in human asthmatics e-co and airway eosinophil counts decreased in response to a one-month treatment with inhaled corticosteroids 73 . in direct contrast to such studies promoting e-co as a useful noninvasive tool for monitoring airway inflammation other studies reported no difference in e-co levels of asthma patients versus healthy controls or between patients with stable and unstable asthma. in one such report no further change in e-co occurred in asthma patients after a one-month treatment of inhaled corticosteroids despite observed decreases in airway eosinophil content and bronchial responsiveness to metacholine 76 . a recent study accentuates this finding in asthma excerbations where no decrease in e-co of children with asthma could be detected after oral prednisolone treatment 77 . in human allergic responses results on elevation of e-co are also inconclusive. a clear elevation of e-co after allergen exposure occurred in patients with asthma during the late response and during the early response immediately after the inhalation 78 . however another report showed that no elevation of e-co occurred in allergen-induced asthma within 48 hours after allergen challenge 79 . finally increases in e-co were measured in allergic rhinitis correlating with seasonal changes in exposure to allergen pollen 80 . airway inflammation plays an important role in the development of copd characterized by the presence of macrophages neutrophils and inflammatory mediators such as proteinases oxidants and cytokines. furthermore the inflammatory consequences of chronic microbiological infections may contribute to the progression of the disease. the current paradigm for the pathogenesis of copd involves imbalances in protease antiprotease activities and antioxidant pro-oxidant status. proteases with tissue-degrading capacity i.e. elastases and matrix metalloproteinases when insufficiently inhibited by antiproteases can induce tissue damage leading to emphysema. oxidants that supersede cellular antioxidant defenses can furthermore inactivate antiproteases cause direct injury to lung tissue and interfere with the repair of the extracellular matrix. smoking plays an important role in both hypotheses. cigarette smoke will act primarily on alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells which react to this oxidative stress by producing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and releasing growth factors. nevertheless smoking cannot be the only factor in the development of copd since only 15 20 of smokers develop the disease 81 82 . exposure to reactive oxygen species from cigarette smoke or chronic infections and an imbalance in oxidant antioxidant status are the main risk factors for the development of copd. to defend against oxidative stress cells and tissues contain endogenous antioxidant defense systems which include millimolar concentrations of the tripeptide glutathione gsh . a close relation exists between gsh concentration and ho-1 whereby depletion of gsh augments the transcriptional regulation of ho-1 by oxidants suggesting that the ho-1 co system acts as a secondary defense against oxidative stress 83-86 . accumulating clinical evidence suggests that ho-1 co may also play an important part in copd. alveolar macrophages which produce a strong ho-1 response to stimuli may represent the main source of co production in the airways 60 64 . patients with copd have displayed higher e-co than healthy nonsmoking controls 87 . furthermore much higher levels of ho-1 have been observed in the airways of smokers than in nonsmokers 64 . among subjects who formerly smoked patients with copd have lower ho-1 expression in alveolar macrophages than healthy subjects 88 . a microsatellite polymorphism that is linked with the development of copd may occur in the promoter region of ho-1 resulting in a lower production of ho-1 in people who have the polymorphism. thus a genetically dependent downregulation of ho-1 expression may arise in subpopulations possibly linked to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress 89-91 . future studies on both genetic predisposition and possible therapeutic modalities will reveal the involvement of the ho-1 co system in copd. cystic fibrosis cf involves a deposition of hyperviscous mucus in the airways associated with pulmonary dysfunction and pancreatic insufficiency which may be accompanied by chronic microbiological infections. e-co readings were higher in untreated versus oral-steroid-treated cf patients 92 . furthermore e-co increased in patients during exacerbations of cf correlating to deterioration of the forced expiratory volume in one second fev1 with normalization of the e-co levels after treatment 93 . e-co levels may correlate with exhaled ethane a product of lipid peroxidation that serves as an indirect marker of oxidative stress. both e-co and exhaled ethane were higher in steroid-treated and untreated cf patients than in healthy controls 94 . e-co was higher in children with cf than in control patients. in addition to the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses to continuous infectious pressure in these patients e-co may possibly respond to hypoxia. e-co increased further in cf children following an exercise test and correlated with the degree of oxyhemoglobin desaturation a finding suggestive of an increased ho-1 expression in cf patients during hypoxic states induced by exercise 95 . in patients with pneumonia higher hb-co levels can be measured at the onset of illness with values decreasing to control levels after antibiotic treatment 62 . e-co levels were reported to be higher in lower-respiratory-tract infections and bronchiectasis with normalization after antibiotic treatment 96 97 . furthermore e-co levels in upper-respiratory-tract infections were higher than in healthy controls 74 80 . the relationship between higher measured e-co in these infectious states and higher hb-co levels cannot be concluded from these studies. the role of ho-1 in the development of interstitial lung disease remains undetermined. comparative immunohistochemical analysis has revealed that lung tissue of control subjects patients with sarcoidosis usual interstitial pneumonia and desquamative interstitial pneumonia all showed a high expression of ho-1 in the alveolar macrophages but a weak expression in the fibrotic areas 98 . the antiproliferative properties of ho-1 suggest a possible beneficial role in limiting fibrosis however this hypothesis is complicated by a newly discovered relation between il-10 and ho-1. il-10 produced by bronchial epithelial cells promotes the growth and proliferation of lung fibroblasts 99 . ho-1 expression and co treatment have been shown to increase the production of il-10 in macrophages following proinflammatory stimuli 32 . conversely il-10 induces ho-1 production which is apparently required for the anti-inflammatory action of il-10 100 . a recent report clearly shows the suppression of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by adenovirus-mediated ho-1 gene transfer and overexpression in c57bl 6 mice involving the inhibition of apoptotic cell death 101 . overall more research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of ho-1 in interstitial lung disease and its possible therapeutic implications. ho-1 action may be of great importance in solid tumors an environment that fosters hypoxia oxidative stress and neovascularization. ho-1 may have both pro- and antagonistic effects on tumor growth and survival. ho-1 and co cause growth arrest in cell-culture systems and thus may represent a potential therapeutic modality in modulating tumor growth 16 . the overexpression of ho-1 or administration of co in mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma mouse models resulted in improved survival 90 as well as reduction in tumor size 50 17 . furthermore ho-1 expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas can be useful in identifying patients at low risk of lymph node metastasis. high expression of ho-1 was detected in groups without lymph node metastasis in this report 102 . in contrast to growth arrest ho-1 may protect solid tumors from oxidative stress and hypoxia possibly by promoting neovascularization. in one study zinc protoporphyrin a competitive inhibitor of ho-1 enzyme activity suppressed tumor growth 103 . co may represent a critical mediator of the body's adaptive response to hypoxia a common feature in pulmonary vascular disease 104 . since co can modulate vascular tone by inducing cgmp and large calcium-dependent potassium channels ho-1 and co probably play important roles in pulmonary vascular diseases 54 . a no-mediated ho-1 induction occurred in the hepatopulmonary syndrome during cirrhosis associated with enhancement of vascular relaxation 105 . in portopulmonary hypertension elevated levels of cgmp and inducible nitric oxide synthase inos expression in the vascular endothelium and ho-1 expression in macrophages and bronchial epithelium have been described 106 . in transgenic mice models ho-1- -and ho-1 mice did not differ in their development of pulmonary hypertension following chronic hypoxia treatment despite the development of right ventricular dilation and right myocardial infarction in ho-1- - mice 107 . the preinduction of ho-1 protein with chemical inducers however prevented the development of pulmonary hypertension in the rat lung as a consequence of chronic hypoxia treatment 108 . transgenic mice overexpressing ho-1 in the lung were resistant to hypoxia-induced inflammation and hypertension 109 . further research is needed to elucidate the potential role of ho-1 and co in primary human lung vascular diseases such as primary pulmonary hypertension. supplemental oxygen therapy is often used clinically in the treatment of respiratory failure. exposure to high oxygen tension hyperoxia may cause acute and chronic lung injury by inducing an extensive inflammatory response in the lung that degrades the alveolar-capillary barrier leading to impaired gas exchange and pulmonary edema 110 111 . hyperoxia-induced lung injury causes symptoms in rodents that resemble human acute respiratory distress syndrome 112 . hyperoxia induced ho-1 expression in adult rats but apparently not in neonatal rats in which the expression and activities of ho-1 and ho-2 are developmentally upregulated during the prenatal and early postnatal period 113 . both ho-1 and ho-2 potentially influence pulmonary adaptation to high o2 levels. in one example the adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of ho-1 into rat lungs protected against the development of lung apoptosis and inflammation during hyperoxia 114 . in vitro studies showed that the overexpression of ho-1 in lung epithelial cells or rat fetal lung cells caused growth arrest and conferred resistance against hyperoxia-induced cell death 15 16 . an oxygen-tolerant variant of hamster fibroblasts that moderately overexpressed ho-1 in comparison with the parent line resisted oxygen toxicity in vitro. the treatment of this oxygen-tolerant strain with ho-1 antisense oligonucleotides reduced the resistance to hyperoxia. in contrast additional vector-mediated ho-1 expression did not further increase oxygen tolerance in this model 115 . in vivo studies with gene-deleted mouse strains have provided much information on the roles of ho-1 and ho-2 in oxygen tolerance. dennery et al. demonstrated that heme oxygenase-2 knockout mice ho-2- - were more sensitive to the lethal effects of hyperoxia than wild-type mice 116 . in addition to the absence of ho-2 expression however the mice displayed a compensatory increase in ho-1 protein expression and higher total lung ho activity. thus in this model the combination of ho-2 deletion and ho-1 overexpression resulted in a hyperoxia-sensitive phenotype. recent studies of dennery et al. have shown that ho-1- deleted ho-1- - mice were more resistant to the lethal effects of hyperoxia than the corresponding wild type 117 . the hyperoxia resistance observed in the ho-1- - strain could be reversed by the reintroduction of ho-1 by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer 117 . in contrast mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from ho-1- - mice showed increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of hemin and h2o2 and generated more intracellular reactive oxygen species in response to these agents 118 . both ho-1- - and ho-2- - strains were anemic yet displayed abnormal accumulations of tissue iron. specifically ho-1- - accumulated nonheme iron in the kidney and liver and had decreased total iron content in the lung while ho-2- - mice accumulated total lung iron in the absence of a compensatory increase in ferritin levels 116 119 . the mechanism s by which ho-1 or ho-2 deletions result in accumulation of tissue iron remain unclear. these studies taken together have indicated that animals deficient in either ho-1 and ho-2 display altered sensitivity to oxidative stress conditions. aberrations in the distribution of intra- and extra-cellular iron may underlie in part the differential sensitivity observed 116 117 . otterbein et al. have shown that exogenous co through anti-inflammatory action may protect the lung in a rat model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. the presence of co 250 ppm prolonged the survival of rats in a hyperoxic 95 o2 environment and inhibited the appearance of markers of hyperoxia-induced lung injury i.e. hemorrhage fibrin deposition edema airway protein accumulation and balf neutrophil influx 11 . furthermore in a mouse model co inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines tnf-α il-1β and il-6 in mice induced by the hyperoxia treatment. using gene-deleted mice otterbein and colleagues also observed that the protection afforded by co in this model similar to a lipopolysaccharide-induced model of lung injury depended on the p38 mapk pathway otterbein et al. unpublished observation as reviewed in 3 . in direct contrast to these studies the group of piantadosi and colleagues reported no significant difference in the hyperoxia tolerance of rats at co doses between 50 and 500 ppm 120 . in their model co did not alter the accumulation of fluid in the airway. furthermore co when applied in combination with hyperoxia increased the activity of myeloperoxidase a marker of airway neutrophil influx. this study also suggested that inhalation of co 50 500 ppm did not alter the expression of ho-1 or other antioxidant enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase mnsod in vivo 120 . furthermore piantadosi and colleagues were able to induce oxygen tolerance in rats and ho-1 expression with hemoglobin treatment but this tolerance also occurred in the presence of ho inhibitors thereby not supporting a role for ho activity in oxygen tolerance 121 . although no consensus has been reached as to the protective role of co inhalation and or ho-1 induction in hyperoxic lung injury human studies will be required to show if co will supersede no in providing a significant therapeutic benefit in the context of severe lung diseases 122 . while antioxidant therapies have been examined until now no human studies exist on the role of ho-1 and co in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and bronchopulmonary dysplasia 123 . lung transplantation is the ultimate and often last therapeutic option for several end-stage lung diseases. after lung transplantation there remains an ongoing hazardous situation in which both acute and chronic graft failure as well as complications of the toxic immunosuppressive regimen used i.e. severe bacterial fungal and viral infections renal failure and epstein-barr-virus-related lymphomas determine the outcome 124 . the development of chronic graft failure obliterative bronchiolitis ob determines the overall outcome after lung transplantation. ob which may develop during the first months after transplantation is the main cause of morbidity and death following the first half-year after transplantation despite therapeutic intervention. once ob has developed retransplantation remains the only therapeutic option available 124 125 . little is known about the pathophysiological background of ob. the possible determinants of developing ob include ongoing immunological allograft response hladr mismatch cytomegalovirus infection acute rejection episodes organ-ischemia time and recipient age 125 . ob patients displayed elevated neutrophil counts in the balf and evidence of increased oxidant activity such as increased methionine oxidation in balf protein and decreases in the ratio of gsh to oxidized glutathione gssg in epithelial lining fluid. 126 127 . so far only very limited research data are available on the possible role for ho-1 in allograft rejection after lung transplantation. higher ho-1 expression has been detected in alveolar macrophages from lung tissue in lung transplant recipients with either acute or chronic graft failure than in stable recipients 128 . the protective role of ho-1 against allograft rejection has been shown in other transplantation models in which solid organ transplantation typically benefits from ho-1 modulation. a higher expression of protective genes such as ho-1 has been observed in episodes of acute renal allograft rejection 129 . furthermore the induction of ho-1 alleviates graft-versus-host disease 130 . adenoviral-ho-1 gene therapy resulted in remarkable protection against rejection in rat liver transplants 131 . the upregulation of ho-1 protected pancreatic islet cells from fas-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion supporting an anti-apoptotic function of ho-1 132 133 . ho-1 may confer protection in the early phase after transplantation by inducing th2-dependent cytokines such as il-4 and il-10 while suppressing interferon-γ and il-2 production as demonstrated in a rat liver allograft model 134 . beneficial effects of ho-1 modulation have also been described in xenotransplantation models in which ho-1 gene expression appears functionally associated with xenograft survival 135 . in a mouse-to-rat heart transplant model the effects of ho-1 upregulation could be mimicked by co administration suggesting that ho-derived co suppressed the graft rejection 136 . the authors proposed that co suppressed graft rejection by inhibition of platelet aggregation a process that facilitates vascular thrombosis and myocardial infarction. ho-1 may also contribute to ischemic preconditioning a process of acquired cellular protection against ischemia reperfusion injury as observed in guinea pig transplanted lungs 137 . ho-1 overexpression provided potent protection against cold ischemia reperfusion injury in a rat model through an anti-apoptotic pathway 138 139 . the induction of ho-1 in rats undergoing liver transplantation with cobalt-protoporphyrin or adenoviral-ho-1 gene therapy resulted in protection against ischemia reperfusion injury and improved survival after transplantation possibly by suppression of th1-cytokine production and decreased apoptosis after reperfusion 140 141 . until now no reports have addressed e-co measurements in lung transplantation where it is possible that differences in e-co will be found in patients with acute and chronic allograft rejection. the evolution of co in exhaled breath may serve as a general marker and diagnostic indicator of inflammatory disease states of the lung though more research will be required to verify its reliability. increases in exhaled co presumably reflect changes in systemic and airway heme metabolic activity from the action of ho enzymes. evidence from numerous in vitro and animal studies indicates that ho-1 provides a protective function in many if not all diseases that involve inflammation and oxidative stress. thus the exploitation of ho-1 for therapeutic gain could be achieved through the modulation of ho-1 enzyme activity or its up- and downstream regulatory factors either by gene transfer pharmacological inducers or direct application of co by gas administration or chemical delivery 142-145 . the co-releasing molecules transition metal carbonyls developed by motterlini et al. 144 show promise in the pharmacological delivery of co for therapeutic applications in vascular and immune regulation. the co-releasing molecules have been shown to limit hypertension in vivo and promote vasorelaxation in isolated heart and aortic rings 144 . ultimately the challenge remains in applying the therapeutic potentials of ho-1 to the treatment of human diseases. in vivo models of transplantation have shown that ho-1 gene therapy protects against allograft rejection 129 134 . given the toxic therapy that every transplant patient receives especially after lung transplantation the field of transplantation medicine may bring the first frontier for human applications of ho-1 gene therapy or exogenous co administration. the potential use of inhalation co as a clinical therapeutic in inflammatory lung diseases has also appeared on the horizon. in one promising study an inhalation dose of 1500 ppm co at the rate of 20 times per day for a week produced no cardiovascular side effects 146 . cigarette smoking and co inhalation at identical intervals produced comparable hb-co levels of approximately 5 . the question of whether or not co can be used as an inhalation therapy will soon be replaced by questions of how much how long and how often the fear of administering co must be weighed against the severe toxicity of the immunosuppressive agents in current use and the often negative outcome of solid organ transplantation. ap-1

pulmonary medicine heme oxygenase-1 ho-1 an inducible stress protein confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. in addition to its physiological role in heme degradation ho-1 may influence a number of cellular processes including growth inflammation and apoptosis. by virtue of anti-inflammatory effects ho-1 limits tissue damage in response to proinflammatory stimuli and prevents allograft rejection after transplantation. the transcriptional upregulation of ho-1 responds to many agents such as hypoxia bacterial lipopolysaccharide and reactive oxygen nitrogen species. ho-1 and its constitutively expressed isozyme heme oxygenase-2 catalyze the rate-limiting step in the conversion of heme to its metabolites bilirubin ixα ferrous iron and carbon monoxide co . the mechanisms by which ho-1 provides protection most likely involve its enzymatic reaction products. remarkably administration of co at low concentrations can substitute for ho-1 with respect to anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects suggesting a role for co as a key mediator of ho-1 function. chronic low-level exogenous exposure to co from cigarette smoking contributes to the importance of co in pulmonary medicine. the implications of the ho-1 co system in pulmonary diseases will be discussed in this review with an emphasis on inflammatory states. the heme oxygenase-1 carbon monoxide ho-1 co system has recently seen an explosion of research interest due to its newly discovered physiological effects. this metabolic pathway first characterized by tenhunen et al. 1 2 has only recently revealed its surprising cytoprotective properties 3 4 . research in ho-1 co now embraces the entire field of medicine where reactive oxygen nitrogen species inflammation growth control and apoptosis represent important pathophysiological mechanisms 3-6 . indeed the number of publications in recent years concerning ho-1 has increased exponentially while the list of diseases and physiological responses associated with changes in ho-1 continues to expand 5 . until now relatively few studies have addressed the role of ho-1 co in pulmonary medicine. several investigators have focused on the diagnostic application of the ho-1 co system by measuring exhaled co e-co in various pathological pulmonary conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd 7 . in another experimental approach investigators have examined the expression of ho-1 in lung tissue from healthy or diseased subjects 8 9 . this review will highlight the actions of ho-1 co in the context of pulmonary diseases fig. 1 emphasizing potential protective effects against inflammation allergic reactions oxidative stress endotoxin shock apoptosis and tumor cell growth 10-17 . heme oxygenase ho ec 1.14.99.3 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in heme degradation. in the ho reaction the oxidation of heme generates equimolar ferrous iron biliverdin ixα and co. nad p h biliverdin reductase subsequently converts bilverdin ixα into bilirubin ixα 1 . the bile pigments generated during heme degradation have antioxidant properties 18 19 . the liberated heme iron undergoes detoxification either by extracellular efflux or by sequestration into ferritin an intracellular iron-storage molecule with potential cytoprotective function 20-23 . of the three known isoforms of ho ho-1 ho-2 and ho-3 only ho-1 responds to xenobiotic induction 24-27 . constitutively expressed in many tissues ho-2 occurs at high levels in nervous and vascular tissues and may respond to regulation by glucocorticoids 25 28 29 . ho-1 and ho-2 differ in genetic origin in primary structure in molecular weight and in their substrate and kinetic parameters 25 26 . ho-3 displays a high sequence homology with ho-2 but has little enzymatic activity 27 . this review will focus on the inducible ho-1 form. in addition to the physiological substrate heme ho-1 responds to induction by a wide variety of stimuli associated with oxidative stress. such inducing agents include hypoxia hyperoxia cytokines nitric oxide no heavy metals ultraviolet-a 320 380 nm radiation heat shock shear stress hydrogen peroxide and thiol -sh -reactive substances 3 . the multiplicity of toxic inducers suggest that ho-1 may function as a critical cytoprotective molecule 3 4 . many studies have suggested that ho-1 acts as an inducible defense against oxidative stress in models of inflammation ischemia-reperfusion hypoxia and hyperoxia-mediated injury reviewed in 3 . the mechanisms by which ho-1 can mediate cytoprotection are still poorly understood. all three products of the ho reaction potentially participate in cellular defense of which the gaseous molecule co has recently received the most attention 30 31 . the administration of co at low concentrations can compensate for the protective effects of ho-1 in the presence of competitive inhibitors of ho-1 activity 32-34 . while ho-1 gene transfer confers protection against oxidative stress in a number of systems clearly not all studies support a beneficial role for ho-1 expression. cell-culture studies have suggested that the protective effects of ho-1 overexpression fall within a critical range such that the excess production of ho-1 or ho-2 may be counterprotective due to a transient excess of reactive iron generated during active heme metabolism 35 36 . thus an important caveat of comparative studies on the therapeutic effects of co administration versus ho-1 gene delivery arises from the fact that the latter approach in addition to producing co may have profound effects on intracellular iron metabolism. ho-1 expression is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level. genetic analyses have revealed two enhancer sequences e1 e2 in the murine ho-1 gene located at -4 kb e1 and -10 kbp e2 of the transcriptional start site 37 38 . these enhancers mediate the induction of ho-1 by many agents including heavy metals phorbol esters endotoxin oxidants and heme. e1 and e2 contain repeated stress-responsive elements which consist of overlapping binding sites for transcription factors including activator protein-1 ap-1 v-maf oncoprotein and the cap'n'collar basic-leucine zipper family of proteins cnc-bzip of which nrf2 nf-e2-related factor may play a critical role in ho-1 transcription 39 . the promoter region of ho-1 also contains potential binding sites for nuclear factor κb nf-κb though the functional significance of these are not clear 40 . both nf-κb and ap-1 have been identified as regulatory elements responsive to oxidative cellular stress 40 41 . in response to hyperoxic stress ap-1 factors mediated the induction of ho-1 in cooperation with signal-transducer and activator of transcription stat proteins 41 . furthermore a distinct hypoxia-response element hre which mediates the ho-1 response to hypoxia represents a binding site for the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 hif-1 42 . the toxic properties of co are well known in the field of pulmonary medicine. this invisible odorless gas still claims many victims each year by accidental exposure. co evolves from the combustion of organic materials and is present in smoke and automobile exhaust. the toxic actions of co relate to its high affinity for hemoglobin 240-fold greater than that of o2 . co replaces o2 rapidly from hemoglobin causing tissue hypoxia 43-45 . at high concentrations other mechanisms of co-induced toxicity may include apoptosis lipid peroxidation and inhibition of drug metabolism and respiratory enzyme functions 44 . only recently has it become known that at very low concentrations co participates in many physiological reactions. where a co exposure of 10 000 parts per million ppm 1 by volume co in air is toxic 100 250 ppm one hundredth to one fortieth as much will stimulate the physiological effects without apparent toxicity 4 . the majority of endogenous co production originates from active heme metabolism 86 though a portion may be produced in lipid peroxidation and drug metabolism reactions 46 . cigarette smoking still practiced by many lung patients represents a major source of chronic low-level exposure to co. inhaled co initially targets alveolar macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells. the exact mechanisms by which co acts at the molecular level remain incompletely understood. co potentially exerts its physiological effects by influencing at least three known pathways fig. 2 . by complexation with the heme moiety of the enzyme co activates soluble guanylate cyclase sgc stimulating the production of cyclic 3' 5'-guanosine monophosphate cgmp 47 . the sgc cgmp pathway mediates the effects of co on vascular relaxation smooth muscle cell relaxation bronchodilation neurotransmission and the inhibition of platelet aggregation coagulation and smooth muscle proliferation 48-51 . furthermore co may cause vascular relaxation by directly activating calcium-dependent potassium channels 52-54 . co potentially influences other intracellular signal transduction pathways. the mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk pathways which transduce oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling i.e. response to lipopolysaccharide may represent an important target of co action 32 34 55 56 . an anti-apoptotic effect of co and its relation to mapk has recently been described. the overexpression of ho-1 or the exogenous administration of co prevented tumor necrosis factor α tnf-α -induced apoptosis in murine fibroblasts 57 . in endothelial cells the anti-apoptotic effect of co depended on the modulation of the p38 38 kilodalton protein mapk pathway 34 . the role of the remaining heme metabolites i.e. fe and biliverdin ixα in the modulation of apoptosis is currently being investigated and is beyond the scope of this review. recent studies have reported a potent anti-inflammatory effect of co involving the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production after endotoxin stimulation dependent on the modulation of p38 mapk 32 . the clinical relevance of p38 mapk lies in the possibility of modulating this pathway in various clinical conditions to downregulate the inflammatory response 58 . oxidative stress arising from an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants plays a central role in the pathogenesis of airway disease 59 . in lung tissue ho-1 expression may occur in respiratory epithelial cells fibroblasts endothelial cells and to a large extent in alveolar macrophages 41 60 61 . ho-1 induction in these tissues in vitro and in vivo responds to common causes of oxidative stress to the airways including hyperoxia hypoxia endotoxemia heavy metal exposure bleomycin diesel exhaust particles and allergen exposure 4 41 61 . induction of ho-1 or administration of co can protect cells from these stressful stimuli 10 41 . in one of the experiments that best illustrate the protective role of co in vivo rats were exposed to hyperoxia 98 o2 in the absence or presence of co at low concentration 250 ppm . the co-treated rats showed increased survival and a diminished inflammatory response to the hyperoxia 11 . as demonstrated in a model of endotoxin-induced inflammation the protection afforded by co most likely resulted from the downregulated synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines i.e. tnf-α il-1β and the upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 il-10 32 . furthermore increases in exhaled co e-co have been reported in a number of pathological pulmonary conditions such as unstable asthma copd and infectious lung disease these increases may reflect increased endogenous ho-1 activity 7 . elevated carboxyhemoglobin hb-co levels have also been reported in these same diseases in nonsmoking subjects where both the e-co and hb-co levels decrease to normal levels in response to therapy 62 . e-co in humans originates primarily from both systemic heme metabolism which produces co in various tissues and localized lung heme metabolism as a result of the combined action of inducible ho-1 and constitutive ho-2 enzymatic activity. endogenously produced or inspired co is eliminated exclusively by respiration 63 . elevation of e-co may also reflect an increase in exogenous sources such as smoking or air pollution. in addition to changes in environmental factors elevations of e-co in lung diseases may reflect an increase in blood hb-co levels in response to systemic inflammation as well as an increase in pulmonary ho-1 expression in response to local inflammation 9 62 64 . the diagnostic value of measuring e-co remains controversial due to many conflicting reports i.e. some reports indicate differences in e-co measurements between disease activity and controls and some reports do not . the possible explanations for these discrepancies include large differences in patient populations and in the methods used for measuring e-co and undefined corrections for background levels of co. furthermore remarkable differences arise between studies in the magnitude of the e-co levels in the control groups as well as in treated or untreated asthma patients. when active or passive smoking occurs or in the presence of high background levels of co the measurement of e-co is not particularly useful for monitoring airway inflammation. in patients who smoke e-co can be used only to confirm the smoking habit 65 66 . comparable to the beginning era of measurements of exhaled no a standardization in techniques and agreement on background correction should be reached for e-co measurements to allow proper conclusions to be drawn in this area of investigation. asthma a form of allergic lung disease features an accumulation of inflammatory cells and mucus in the airways associated with bronchoconstriction and a generalized airflow limitation. inflammation a key component of asthma involves multiple cells and mediators where an imbalance in oxidants antioxidants contributes to cell damage. several pathways associated with oxidative stress may participate in asthma. for example the redox-sensitive transcription factors nf-κb and ap-1 control the expression of proinflammatory mediators 59 67-69 . in light of the potential protective effects of ho-1 co on inflammatory processes the study of ho-1 in asthma has gained popularity. in a mouse model of asthma ho-1 expression increased in lung tissue in response to ovalbumin aerosol challenge indicating a role for ho-1 in asthma 70 . in a similar model of aeroallergen-induced asthma in ovalbumin-sensitized mice exposure to a co atmosphere resulted in a marked attenuation of eosinophil content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf and downregulation of the proinflammatory cytokine il-5 10 . this experiment showed that exogenous co can inhibit asthmatic responses to allergens in mice. recent human studies have revealed higher ho-1 expression in the alveolar macrophages and higher e-co in untreated asthmatic patients than in healthy nonsmoking controls 71 72 . patients with exacerbations of asthma and patients who were withdrawn from inhaled steroids showed higher e-co levels than steroid-treated asthmatics or healthy controls 73 . higher levels of e-co may also occur in children with persistent asthma than in healthy controls 74 . e-co levels may correlate with functional parameters such as peak expiratory flow rate. a low rate in asthma exacerbations correlated with high e-co whereas normalization of the rate with oral glucocorticoid treatment resulted in a reduction of e-co 75 . furthermore increased e-co was associated with greater expression of ho-1 in airway alveolar macrophages obtained by induced sputum in untreated asthmatic patients than in controls. these asthma patients also showed higher bilirubin levels in the induced sputum indicating higher ho activity 71 . furthermore patients with asthma show an increased hb-co level at the time of exacerbation with values decreasing to control levels after oral glucocorticoid treatment 62 . in human asthmatics e-co and airway eosinophil counts decreased in response to a one-month treatment with inhaled corticosteroids 73 . in direct contrast to such studies promoting e-co as a useful noninvasive tool for monitoring airway inflammation other studies reported no difference in e-co levels of asthma patients versus healthy controls or between patients with stable and unstable asthma. in one such report no further change in e-co occurred in asthma patients after a one-month treatment of inhaled corticosteroids despite observed decreases in airway eosinophil content and bronchial responsiveness to metacholine 76 . a recent study accentuates this finding in asthma excerbations where no decrease in e-co of children with asthma could be detected after oral prednisolone treatment 77 . in human allergic responses results on elevation of e-co are also inconclusive. a clear elevation of e-co after allergen exposure occurred in patients with asthma during the late response and during the early response immediately after the inhalation 78 . however another report showed that no elevation of e-co occurred in allergen-induced asthma within 48 hours after allergen challenge 79 . finally increases in e-co were measured in allergic rhinitis correlating with seasonal changes in exposure to allergen pollen 80 . airway inflammation plays an important role in the development of copd characterized by the presence of macrophages neutrophils and inflammatory mediators such as proteinases oxidants and cytokines. furthermore the inflammatory consequences of chronic microbiological infections may contribute to the progression of the disease. the current paradigm for the pathogenesis of copd involves imbalances in protease antiprotease activities and antioxidant pro-oxidant status. proteases with tissue-degrading capacity i.e. elastases and matrix metalloproteinases when insufficiently inhibited by antiproteases can induce tissue damage leading to emphysema. oxidants that supersede cellular antioxidant defenses can furthermore inactivate antiproteases cause direct injury to lung tissue and interfere with the repair of the extracellular matrix. smoking plays an important role in both hypotheses. cigarette smoke will act primarily on alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells which react to this oxidative stress by producing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and releasing growth factors. nevertheless smoking cannot be the only factor in the development of copd since only 15 20 of smokers develop the disease 81 82 . exposure to reactive oxygen species from cigarette smoke or chronic infections and an imbalance in oxidant antioxidant status are the main risk factors for the development of copd. to defend against oxidative stress cells and tissues contain endogenous antioxidant defense systems which include millimolar concentrations of the tripeptide glutathione gsh . a close relation exists between gsh concentration and ho-1 whereby depletion of gsh augments the transcriptional regulation of ho-1 by oxidants suggesting that the ho-1 co system acts as a secondary defense against oxidative stress 83-86 . accumulating clinical evidence suggests that ho-1 co may also play an important part in copd. alveolar macrophages which produce a strong ho-1 response to stimuli may represent the main source of co production in the airways 60 64 . patients with copd have displayed higher e-co than healthy nonsmoking controls 87 . furthermore much higher levels of ho-1 have been observed in the airways of smokers than in nonsmokers 64 . among subjects who formerly smoked patients with copd have lower ho-1 expression in alveolar macrophages than healthy subjects 88 . a microsatellite polymorphism that is linked with the development of copd may occur in the promoter region of ho-1 resulting in a lower production of ho-1 in people who have the polymorphism. thus a genetically dependent downregulation of ho-1 expression may arise in subpopulations possibly linked to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress 89-91 . future studies on both genetic predisposition and possible therapeutic modalities will reveal the involvement of the ho-1 co system in copd. cystic fibrosis cf involves a deposition of hyperviscous mucus in the airways associated with pulmonary dysfunction and pancreatic insufficiency which may be accompanied by chronic microbiological infections. e-co readings were higher in untreated versus oral-steroid-treated cf patients 92 . furthermore e-co increased in patients during exacerbations of cf correlating to deterioration of the forced expiratory volume in one second fev1 with normalization of the e-co levels after treatment 93 . e-co levels may correlate with exhaled ethane a product of lipid peroxidation that serves as an indirect marker of oxidative stress. both e-co and exhaled ethane were higher in steroid-treated and untreated cf patients than in healthy controls 94 . e-co was higher in children with cf than in control patients. in addition to the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses to continuous infectious pressure in these patients e-co may possibly respond to hypoxia. e-co increased further in cf children following an exercise test and correlated with the degree of oxyhemoglobin desaturation a finding suggestive of an increased ho-1 expression in cf patients during hypoxic states induced by exercise 95 . in patients with pneumonia higher hb-co levels can be measured at the onset of illness with values decreasing to control levels after antibiotic treatment 62 . e-co levels were reported to be higher in lower-respiratory-tract infections and bronchiectasis with normalization after antibiotic treatment 96 97 . furthermore e-co levels in upper-respiratory-tract infections were higher than in healthy controls 74 80 . the relationship between higher measured e-co in these infectious states and higher hb-co levels cannot be concluded from these studies. the role of ho-1 in the development of interstitial lung disease remains undetermined. comparative immunohistochemical analysis has revealed that lung tissue of control subjects patients with sarcoidosis usual interstitial pneumonia and desquamative interstitial pneumonia all showed a high expression of ho-1 in the alveolar macrophages but a weak expression in the fibrotic areas 98 . the antiproliferative properties of ho-1 suggest a possible beneficial role in limiting fibrosis however this hypothesis is complicated by a newly discovered relation between il-10 and ho-1. il-10 produced by bronchial epithelial cells promotes the growth and proliferation of lung fibroblasts 99 . ho-1 expression and co treatment have been shown to increase the production of il-10 in macrophages following proinflammatory stimuli 32 . conversely il-10 induces ho-1 production which is apparently required for the anti-inflammatory action of il-10 100 . a recent report clearly shows the suppression of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by adenovirus-mediated ho-1 gene transfer and overexpression in c57bl 6 mice involving the inhibition of apoptotic cell death 101 . overall more research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of ho-1 in interstitial lung disease and its possible therapeutic implications. ho-1 action may be of great importance in solid tumors an environment that fosters hypoxia oxidative stress and neovascularization. ho-1 may have both pro- and antagonistic effects on tumor growth and survival. ho-1 and co cause growth arrest in cell-culture systems and thus may represent a potential therapeutic modality in modulating tumor growth 16 . the overexpression of ho-1 or administration of co in mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma mouse models resulted in improved survival 90 as well as reduction in tumor size 50 17 . furthermore ho-1 expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas can be useful in identifying patients at low risk of lymph node metastasis. high expression of ho-1 was detected in groups without lymph node metastasis in this report 102 . in contrast to growth arrest ho-1 may protect solid tumors from oxidative stress and hypoxia possibly by promoting neovascularization. in one study zinc protoporphyrin a competitive inhibitor of ho-1 enzyme activity suppressed tumor growth 103 . co may represent a critical mediator of the body's adaptive response to hypoxia a common feature in pulmonary vascular disease 104 . since co can modulate vascular tone by inducing cgmp and large calcium-dependent potassium channels ho-1 and co probably play important roles in pulmonary vascular diseases 54 . a no-mediated ho-1 induction occurred in the hepatopulmonary syndrome during cirrhosis associated with enhancement of vascular relaxation 105 . in portopulmonary hypertension elevated levels of cgmp and inducible nitric oxide synthase inos expression in the vascular endothelium and ho-1 expression in macrophages and bronchial epithelium have been described 106 . in transgenic mice models ho-1- -and ho-1 mice did not differ in their development of pulmonary hypertension following chronic hypoxia treatment despite the development of right ventricular dilation and right myocardial infarction in ho-1- - mice 107 . the preinduction of ho-1 protein with chemical inducers however prevented the development of pulmonary hypertension in the rat lung as a consequence of chronic hypoxia treatment 108 . transgenic mice overexpressing ho-1 in the lung were resistant to hypoxia-induced inflammation and hypertension 109 . further research is needed to elucidate the potential role of ho-1 and co in primary human lung vascular diseases such as primary pulmonary hypertension. supplemental oxygen therapy is often used clinically in the treatment of respiratory failure. exposure to high oxygen tension hyperoxia may cause acute and chronic lung injury by inducing an extensive inflammatory response in the lung that degrades the alveolar-capillary barrier leading to impaired gas exchange and pulmonary edema 110 111 . hyperoxia-induced lung injury causes symptoms in rodents that resemble human acute respiratory distress syndrome 112 . hyperoxia induced ho-1 expression in adult rats but apparently not in neonatal rats in which the expression and activities of ho-1 and ho-2 are developmentally upregulated during the prenatal and early postnatal period 113 . both ho-1 and ho-2 potentially influence pulmonary adaptation to high o2 levels. in one example the adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of ho-1 into rat lungs protected against the development of lung apoptosis and inflammation during hyperoxia 114 . in vitro studies showed that the overexpression of ho-1 in lung epithelial cells or rat fetal lung cells caused growth arrest and conferred resistance against hyperoxia-induced cell death 15 16 . an oxygen-tolerant variant of hamster fibroblasts that moderately overexpressed ho-1 in comparison with the parent line resisted oxygen toxicity in vitro. the treatment of this oxygen-tolerant strain with ho-1 antisense oligonucleotides reduced the resistance to hyperoxia. in contrast additional vector-mediated ho-1 expression did not further increase oxygen tolerance in this model 115 . in vivo studies with gene-deleted mouse strains have provided much information on the roles of ho-1 and ho-2 in oxygen tolerance. dennery et al. demonstrated that heme oxygenase-2 knockout mice ho-2- - were more sensitive to the lethal effects of hyperoxia than wild-type mice 116 . in addition to the absence of ho-2 expression however the mice displayed a compensatory increase in ho-1 protein expression and higher total lung ho activity. thus in this model the combination of ho-2 deletion and ho-1 overexpression resulted in a hyperoxia-sensitive phenotype. recent studies of dennery et al. have shown that ho-1- deleted ho-1- - mice were more resistant to the lethal effects of hyperoxia than the corresponding wild type 117 . the hyperoxia resistance observed in the ho-1- - strain could be reversed by the reintroduction of ho-1 by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer 117 . in contrast mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from ho-1- - mice showed increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of hemin and h2o2 and generated more intracellular reactive oxygen species in response to these agents 118 . both ho-1- - and ho-2- - strains were anemic yet displayed abnormal accumulations of tissue iron. specifically ho-1- - accumulated nonheme iron in the kidney and liver and had decreased total iron content in the lung while ho-2- - mice accumulated total lung iron in the absence of a compensatory increase in ferritin levels 116 119 . the mechanism s by which ho-1 or ho-2 deletions result in accumulation of tissue iron remain unclear. these studies taken together have indicated that animals deficient in either ho-1 and ho-2 display altered sensitivity to oxidative stress conditions. aberrations in the distribution of intra- and extra-cellular iron may underlie in part the differential sensitivity observed 116 117 . otterbein et al. have shown that exogenous co through anti-inflammatory action may protect the lung in a rat model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. the presence of co 250 ppm prolonged the survival of rats in a hyperoxic 95 o2 environment and inhibited the appearance of markers of hyperoxia-induced lung injury i.e. hemorrhage fibrin deposition edema airway protein accumulation and balf neutrophil influx 11 . furthermore in a mouse model co inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines tnf-α il-1β and il-6 in mice induced by the hyperoxia treatment. using gene-deleted mice otterbein and colleagues also observed that the protection afforded by co in this model similar to a lipopolysaccharide-induced model of lung injury depended on the p38 mapk pathway otterbein et al. unpublished observation as reviewed in 3 . in direct contrast to these studies the group of piantadosi and colleagues reported no significant difference in the hyperoxia tolerance of rats at co doses between 50 and 500 ppm 120 . in their model co did not alter the accumulation of fluid in the airway. furthermore co when applied in combination with hyperoxia increased the activity of myeloperoxidase a marker of airway neutrophil influx. this study also suggested that inhalation of co 50 500 ppm did not alter the expression of ho-1 or other antioxidant enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase mnsod in vivo 120 . furthermore piantadosi and colleagues were able to induce oxygen tolerance in rats and ho-1 expression with hemoglobin treatment but this tolerance also occurred in the presence of ho inhibitors thereby not supporting a role for ho activity in oxygen tolerance 121 . although no consensus has been reached as to the protective role of co inhalation and or ho-1 induction in hyperoxic lung injury human studies will be required to show if co will supersede no in providing a significant therapeutic benefit in the context of severe lung diseases 122 . while antioxidant therapies have been examined until now no human studies exist on the role of ho-1 and co in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and bronchopulmonary dysplasia 123 . lung transplantation is the ultimate and often last therapeutic option for several end-stage lung diseases. after lung transplantation there remains an ongoing hazardous situation in which both acute and chronic graft failure as well as complications of the toxic immunosuppressive regimen used i.e. severe bacterial fungal and viral infections renal failure and epstein-barr-virus-related lymphomas determine the outcome 124 . the development of chronic graft failure obliterative bronchiolitis ob determines the overall outcome after lung transplantation. ob which may develop during the first months after transplantation is the main cause of morbidity and death following the first half-year after transplantation despite therapeutic intervention. once ob has developed retransplantation remains the only therapeutic option available 124 125 . little is known about the pathophysiological background of ob. the possible determinants of developing ob include ongoing immunological allograft response hladr mismatch cytomegalovirus infection acute rejection episodes organ-ischemia time and recipient age 125 . ob patients displayed elevated neutrophil counts in the balf and evidence of increased oxidant activity such as increased methionine oxidation in balf protein and decreases in the ratio of gsh to oxidized glutathione gssg in epithelial lining fluid. 126 127 . so far only very limited research data are available on the possible role for ho-1 in allograft rejection after lung transplantation. higher ho-1 expression has been detected in alveolar macrophages from lung tissue in lung transplant recipients with either acute or chronic graft failure than in stable recipients 128 . the protective role of ho-1 against allograft rejection has been shown in other transplantation models in which solid organ transplantation typically benefits from ho-1 modulation. a higher expression of protective genes such as ho-1 has been observed in episodes of acute renal allograft rejection 129 . furthermore the induction of ho-1 alleviates graft-versus-host disease 130 . adenoviral-ho-1 gene therapy resulted in remarkable protection against rejection in rat liver transplants 131 . the upregulation of ho-1 protected pancreatic islet cells from fas-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion supporting an anti-apoptotic function of ho-1 132 133 . ho-1 may confer protection in the early phase after transplantation by inducing th2-dependent cytokines such as il-4 and il-10 while suppressing interferon-γ and il-2 production as demonstrated in a rat liver allograft model 134 . beneficial effects of ho-1 modulation have also been described in xenotransplantation models in which ho-1 gene expression appears functionally associated with xenograft survival 135 . in a mouse-to-rat heart transplant model the effects of ho-1 upregulation could be mimicked by co administration suggesting that ho-derived co suppressed the graft rejection 136 . the authors proposed that co suppressed graft rejection by inhibition of platelet aggregation a process that facilitates vascular thrombosis and myocardial infarction. ho-1 may also contribute to ischemic preconditioning a process of acquired cellular protection against ischemia reperfusion injury as observed in guinea pig transplanted lungs 137 . ho-1 overexpression provided potent protection against cold ischemia reperfusion injury in a rat model through an anti-apoptotic pathway 138 139 . the induction of ho-1 in rats undergoing liver transplantation with cobalt-protoporphyrin or adenoviral-ho-1 gene therapy resulted in protection against ischemia reperfusion injury and improved survival after transplantation possibly by suppression of th1-cytokine production and decreased apoptosis after reperfusion 140 141 . until now no reports have addressed e-co measurements in lung transplantation where it is possible that differences in e-co will be found in patients with acute and chronic allograft rejection. the evolution of co in exhaled breath may serve as a general marker and diagnostic indicator of inflammatory disease states of the lung though more research will be required to verify its reliability. increases in exhaled co presumably reflect changes in systemic and airway heme metabolic activity from the action of ho enzymes. evidence from numerous in vitro and animal studies indicates that ho-1 provides a protective function in many if not all diseases that involve inflammation and oxidative stress. thus the exploitation of ho-1 for therapeutic gain could be achieved through the modulation of ho-1 enzyme activity or its up- and downstream regulatory factors either by gene transfer pharmacological inducers or direct application of co by gas administration or chemical delivery 142-145 . the co-releasing molecules transition metal carbonyls developed by motterlini et al. 144 show promise in the pharmacological delivery of co for therapeutic applications in vascular and immune regulation. the co-releasing molecules have been shown to limit hypertension in vivo and promote vasorelaxation in isolated heart and aortic rings 144 . ultimately the challenge remains in applying the therapeutic potentials of ho-1 to the treatment of human diseases. in vivo models of transplantation have shown that ho-1 gene therapy protects against allograft rejection 129 134 . given the toxic therapy that every transplant patient receives especially after lung transplantation the field of transplantation medicine may bring the first frontier for human applications of ho-1 gene therapy or exogenous co administration. the potential use of inhalation co as a clinical therapeutic in inflammatory lung diseases has also appeared on the horizon. in one promising study an inhalation dose of 1500 ppm co at the rate of 20 times per day for a week produced no cardiovascular side effects 146 . cigarette smoking and co inhalation at identical intervals produced comparable hb-co levels of approximately 5 . the question of whether or not co can be used as an inhalation therapy will soon be replaced by questions of how much how long and how often the fear of administering co must be weighed against the severe toxicity of the immunosuppressive agents in current use and the often negative outcome of solid organ transplantation. ap-1 activator protein-1 balf bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cf cystic fibrosis cgmp cyclic 3'

radar\"}, 'biobert': {'title': 'technical description of rods a real-time public health surveillance system', 'abstract': 'this report describes the design and implementation of the real-time outbreak and disease surveillance rods system a computer-based public health surveillance system for early detection of disease outbreaks. hospitals send rods data from clinical encounters over virtual private networks and leased lines using the health level 7 hl7 message protocol. the data are sent in real time. rods automatically classifies the registration chief complaint from the visit into one of seven syndrome categories using bayesian classifiers. it stores the data in a relational database aggregates the data for analysis using data warehousing techniques applies univariate and multivariate statistical detection algorithms to the data and alerts users of when the algorithms identify anomalous patterns in the syndrome counts. rods also has a web-based user interface that supports temporal and spatial analyses. rods processes sales of over-the-counter health care products in a similar manner but receives such data in batch mode on a daily basis. rods was used during the 2002 winter olympics and currently operates in two states pennsylvania and utah. it has been and continues to be a resource for implementing evaluating and applying new methods of public health surveillance.', 'body': \"the role of public health surveillance is to collect analyze and interpret data about biological agents diseases risk factors and other health events and to provide timely dissemination of collected information to decision makers.17 conventionally public health surveillance relies on manual operations and off-line analysis. existing syndromic surveillance systems include the cdc's drop-in surveillance systems 8 early notification of community-based epidemics essence 10 18 the lightweight epidemiology advanced detection and emergency response system leaders 19 the rapid syndrome validation project rsvp 20 and the eight systems discussed by lober et al.11 lober et al. summarized desirable characteristics of syndromic surveillance systems and analyzed the extent to which systems that were in existence in 2001 had those characteristics.11 a limitation of most systems e.g. essence 10 children's hospital in boston 11 university of washington11 was batch transfer of data which may delay detection by as long as the time interval periodicity between batch transfers. for example a surveillance system with daily batch transfer may delay by one day the detection of an outbreak. some systems required manual data input e.g. cdc's drop-in surveillance systems rsvp 20 and leaders19 which is labor-intensive and in the worst case requires round-the-clock staffing. manual data input is not a feasible mid- or long-term solution even if the approach is to add items to existing encounter forms where the items still may be ignored by busy clinicians . a third limitation for existing surveillance systems is that the systems may not exploit existing standards or communication protocols like heath level 7 hl7 even when they are available. the data type most commonly used among surveillance systems is symptoms or diagnoses of patients from ed and or physician office visits. other types of data identified in that study include emergency call center and nurse advice lines. other types of data being used include sales of over-the-counter health care products prescriptions telephone call volumes to health care providers and drug stores and absenteeism. we have conducted studies demonstrating that the free-text chief complaint data that we use correlate with outbreaks.21 22 the overall design objective for rods is similar to that of an early warning system for missile defense namely to collect whatever data are required to achieve early detection from as wide an area as necessary and to analyze the data in a way that they can be used effectively by decision makers. it is required that this analysis be done in close to real time. this design objective is complex and difficult to operationalize because of the large number of organisms and the even larger number of possible routes of dissemination all requiring potentially different types of data for their detection different algorithms and different time urgencies. for this reason our focus since beginning the project in 1999 has been on the specific problem of detecting a large-scale outbreak due to an outdoor outside buildings aerosol release of anthrax. additional design objectives were adherence to nedss standards to ensure future interoperability with other types of public health surveillance systems scalability and that the system could not rely on manual data entry except when it was done in a focused way in response to the system's own analysis of passively collected data. rods uses clinical data that are already being collected by health care providers and systems during the registration process. when a patient arrives at an ed or an instacare in utah the registration clerk or triage nurse elicits the patient's reason for visit i.e. the chief complaint age gender home zip code and other data and enter the data in a registration computer. the registration computer then generates an hl7 adt admission discharge and transfer message and transmits it to the

associated with the upmc health system and efforts to recruit other hospitals met with resistance. after the terrorist attacks including anthrax in the fall of 2001 other hospitals agreed to participate. although data in this project are de-identified certain information such as the number of ed visits by zip code were considered proprietary information by some health systems. health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa concerns also were very prominent in the discussions. data-sharing agreements were executed with every participating health system that addressed these concerns. as an additional precaution all rods project members meet annually with university of pittsburgh council to review obligations and are required to sign an agreement every year stating that they understand the terms of the data-sharing agreements and agree to abide by the terms. rods began as a research project at the university of pittsburgh in 1999 and has functioned with irb approvals since that time. health care facilities send admission discharge and transfer adt hl7 messages to rods for patient visits in eds and walk-in clinics. a minimal data set is sent as shown in which qualifies as a hipaa limited data set.24 currently the data elements are age without date of birth gender home zip code and free-text chief complaint. the hl7 listener receives hl7 messages from the message routers located in each health system. the hl7 listener then passes the received hl7 message to the hl7 parser bean an enterprise javabean ejb in the rods business logic tier. the hl7 parser bean uses regular expressions to parse the fields in an hl7 message. the hl7 parser bean then stores the parsed elements into a database through a managed database connection pool. although nearly all health systems utilize the hl7 messaging standard the location of individual data elements in an hl7 message may differ from health system to health system. for example some care providers' systems record free-text chief complaint in the dg1 segment instead of the pv2 segment of an hl7 message. to resolve this mapping problem a configuration file written in extensible markup language xml a standard protocol often used to define hierarchical data elements defines where each of the data elements can be found in the hl7 message. when an hl7 listener starts up it reads the hospital-dependent configuration file and passes the configuration information to the parser bean. we also use this configuration file to define the database table and field in which the hl7 parser bean should store each data element. this approach is useful because it allows the hl7 data to be stored to an external database. we anticipate that health departments with existing nedss or other public health surveillance databases may wish to use just this component of rods for real-time collection of clinical data. for hospitals that do not have hl7 message routers two of approximately 60 in our experience to date rods accepts ed registration data files through either a secure web-based data upload interface or a secure file transfer protocol. in general these types of data transfers are technically trivial and for that reason are used by many groups but do not have the reliability of a hl7 connection and have very undesirable time latencies . rods checks the integrity of the data in the hl7 messages that it receives. this processing is necessary because hospital data flows may have undesirable characteristics such as duplicates. rods identifies and deletes duplicates by using a database trigger that creates a composite primary key before inserting the data. rods also filters out scheduling messages which are identified by the fact that they have future admitted date and time. rods monitors all data feeds to ensure continuous connections with health systems. if rods does not receive data for six hours it sends an alert to the rods administrator and the sending health system's administrator. because the commercial message routers that hospitals use queue up hl7 messages when encountering networking or system problems data integrity is preserved. rods uses an oracle8i database to store ed registration data. oracle redwood shores ca . to ensure fast response for an online query e.g. the daily counts of respiratory syndrome in a county for the past six months we developed a cache table scheme that pre-aggregates counts and refreshes them every 30 minutes.25 the communications network between rods and health care systems consists of virtual private networks vpn and leased lines. rods uses multivendor site-to-site internet protocol security ipsec vpns to receive hl7 messages. during the winter olympics we exclusively used leased lines for the primary connection because of concerns about possible communications interruptions due to internet traffic related to the games. the leased lines consisted of a redundant pair of 128k fractional t1 lines. after the olympics we returned to use of vpns and rods has operated reliably using vpns in both utah and pennsylvania. the leased-line modality is used only to connect the siemens medical systems data center with rods for the transmission of data from nine health systems that are hosted by siemens. for connectivity with the hl7 message routers we utilize hardware-based routers. the vpn router is a cisco pix 501 and the leased-line routers are a pair of cisco 2600s cisco systems inc. san jose ca . all of the rods processes can be run on a single computer but in our current implementation serving pennsylvania and utah as an application service provider we use five dedicated servers firewall database web server a geographic information system gis server and computation. the processes are written in java code and can run on most platforms but here we describe the specific platforms we use to indicate approximate sizing and processing requirements. the database server is a sun microsystems enterprise 250 configured with two ultrasparc ii 400mhz processors 2 gigabytes of ram and 36 gigabytes of mirrored hard drive space running an oracle 8.1.7 database on solaris 8 sun microsystems inc. santa clara ca . the web server is a dell poweredge 1550 configured with two 1ghz pentium iii processors 1 gigabyte of ram and 36 gigabytes of redundant arrays of inexpensive disk 5 raid-5 storage running apache 1.3.24 web server and jboss 3.0 described below in fault tolerance on redhat linux 7.1 dell computer corporation round rock tx jboss group atlanta ga red hat raleigh nc . the gis server is a dell poweredge 350 configured with one 1ghz pentium iii processor 512 megabytes of ram and 18 gigabytes of storage running arcims 4.0 esri inc. redlands ca an internet-enabled geographic information system on redhat linux 7.3. the computation server is a penguin computing server configured with dual athlon mp 2400s 1 gigabyte of ram and 750 gigabytes of raid-5 storage running oracle 9i on redhat linux 7.3. backup is performed nightly on all machines using a sun storeedge l9 tape autoloader attached to the database server and veritas netbackup software veritas mountain view ca . rods uses a naive bayesian classifier called complaint coder coco to classify free-text chief complaints into one of the following syndromic categories constitutional respiratory gastrointestinal neurological botulinic rash hemorrhagic and other. coco computes the probability of each category conditioned on each word in a free-text chief complaint and assigns a patient to the category with the highest probability.27 the probability distributions used by coco are learned from a manually created training set. coco can be retrained with local data and it can be trained to detect a different set of syndromes than we currently use. coco runs as a local process on the rods database server. coco was developed at the university of pittsburgh and is available for free download at http health.pitt.edu rods sw . over the course of the project rods has used two detection algorithms. these algorithms have not been formally field tested because the emphasis of the project to date has been on developing the data collection infrastructure more than field testing of algorithms. the recursive-least-square rls adaptive filter28 currently runs every four hours and alerts are sent to public health officials in utah and pennsylvania. rls a dynamic autoregressive linear model computes an expected count for each syndrome category for seven counties in utah and 16 counties in pennsylvania as well as for the combined counts for each state. we use rls because it has a minimal reliance on historical data for setting model parameters and a high sensitivity to rapid increases in a time series e.g. a sudden increase in daily counts. rls triggers an alert when the current actual count exceeds the 95 confidence interval for the predicted count. during the 2002 olympics we also used the what's strange about recent events wsare 1.0 algorithm.29 wsare performs a heuristic search over combinations of temporal and spatial features to detect anomalous densities of cases in space and time. such features include all aspects of recent patient records including syndromal categories age gender and geographical information about patients. the criteria used in the past for sending a wsare 1.0 alert was that there has been an increase in the number of patients with specific characteristics relative to the counts on the same day of the week during recent weeks and the p-value after careful adjustment for multiple testing for the increase was 0.05. version 3.0 of wsare which will incorporate a bayesian model for computing expected counts rather than using unadjusted historical counts currently is under development. when an algorithm triggers an alert based on the above criteria rods sends e-mail and or page alerts to its users. rods uses an xml-based configuration file to define users' e-mail and pager addresses. the e-mail version of the alert includes a url link to a graph of the time series that triggered the alarm with two comparison time series total visits for the same time period and normalized counts. rods has a password-protected encrypted web site at which users can review health care registration and sales of otc health care products on epidemic plots and maps. when a user logs in rods will check the user's profile and will display data only for his or her health department's jurisdiction. the interface comprises three screens main epiplot and mapplot. the main screen alternates views automatically among each of the available data sources currently health care registrations and otc products in pennsylvania and utah and otc sales only for other states . the view alternates every two minutes as shown in . the clinic visits view shows daily total visits and seven daily syndromes for the past week. the otc data view shows daily sales for five product categories and the total also for the past week. users also can set the view to a specific county in a state. if the normalize control box is checked the counts in the time series being displayed will be divided by normalized by the total daily sales of otc health care products or ed visits for the region. the epiplot screen provides a general epidemic plotting capability. the user can simultaneously view a mixture of different syndromes and otc product categories for any geographic region state county or zip code and for any time interval. the user also can retrieve case details as shown in . the get cases button queries the database for the admission date age zip code and chief complaint verbatim not classified into syndrome category of all patients in the time interval and typically is used to examine an anomalous density spike of cases. the download data button will download data as a compressed comma separated file for further analyses. the mapplot screen is an interface to arcims an internet-enabled gis product developed by environmental systems research institute inc. mapplot colors zip code regions to indicate the proportion of patients presenting with a particular syndrome. the gis server also can overlay state boundaries county boundaries water bodies hospital locations landmarks streets and highways on the public health data as shown in . similar to epiplot mapplot also can display case details for a user-selected zip code. rods has been in operation for four years and like most production systems has acquired many fault-tolerant features. for example at the software level hl7 listeners continue to receive messages and temporarily store the messages when the database is off-line. a data manager program runs every ten minutes and on finding such a cache it loads the unstored messages to the database when the database is back on-line. in addition the data manager program monitors and restarts hl7 listeners as necessary. the database uses archive log mode to log every transaction to ensure that the database can recover from a system failure. the hardware architecture also is fault tolerant. all servers have dual power supplies and dual network cards. all hard drives use redundant arrays of inexpensive disk configurations. in addition to dual power supplies all machines are connected to an uninterrupted power supply that is capable of sending an e-mail alert to the rods administrator when the main power is down. an important component of rods that currently is used only at the upmc health system in pittsburgh is the health system resident component hsrc . the hsrc is located within the firewall of a health system and connects directly to the hl7 message router. the hsrc currently receives a diverse set of clinical data from the hl7 message router including culture results radiology reports and dictated emergency room notes. its purpose is to provide additional public health surveillance functions that would not be possible if it were located outside of the firewall due to restrictions on the release of identifiable clinical data. the hsrc uses patient identifiers to link laboratory and radiology information to perform case detection. in the past we have used hsrc to monitor for patients with both a gram-positive rod in a preliminary microbiology culture report and mediastinal widening in a radiology report. the hsrc is a case detector in a distributed outbreak detection system that is capable of achieving much higher specificity of patient diagnostic categorization through access to more information. hsrc also removes identifiable information before transmitting data to the rods system a function provided by the health system's message router in other hospitals that connect to rods. the hsrc at upmc health system functions as an electronic laboratory reporting system although the state and local health departments are not yet ready to receive real-time messaging from the system. currently it sends email alerts to the director of the laboratory and hospital infection control group about positive cultures for organisms that are required to be reported to public health in the state of pennsylvania.30 it also sends messages to hospital infection control when it detects organisms that cause nosocomial infections. these organisms include clostridium difficile methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. we have been able in hsrc to prototype one additional feature which is a look-back function that facilitates very rapid outbreak investigations by providing access to electronic medical records to public health investigators as shown in . this feature requires a token that can be passed to a hospital information system that can uniquely identify a patient and the reason we have prototyped this feature in the hsrc and not in rods is simply that hsrc runs within the firewall so an unencrypted token can be used. the look-back is accomplished as follows when a public health user identifies an anonymous patient record of interest e.g. one of 20 patients with diarrhea today from one zip code hsrc calls the upmc health system web-based electronic medical record system and passes it the patient identifier. upmc health system then requests the user to log in using the upmc-issued password before providing access to the record directly from its own secure web site. this approach is not intended to be implemented in hsrc but rather in the rods system outside of the firewall of a health system. it is intended to use encrypted identifiers that the health system would decrypt to retrieve the correct record. the hsrc could provide the encryption-decryption service or it could be provided by another data system in the hospital. we estimate that the prevalence of health systems that have web-based results review in the united states is 30 to 50 and growing so that this approach could very quickly improve the efficiency of outbreak investigations. rods has been in operation in pennsylvania since 1999 and in utah since january 2002. in utah rods receives data from two health systems intermountain heath care including nine eds and 18 acute care facilities and the university of utah health sciences center with one ed.24 together these facilities serve about 70 of the population of utah. in pennsylvania rods receives data from 20 health systems comprising 38 hospitals. two health systems each with one hospital send plain text files to rods on a daily basis. in pennsylvania rods covers 80 of ed visits in allegheny county population 1.3 m where pittsburgh is located 50 of visits in the 13-county metropolitan medical response area centered on pittsburgh population 3.0 m and more than 70 coverage of three other counties including dauphin county where harrisburg the capital of pennsylvania is located. the commonwealth of pennsylvania is funding a large project to connect the remaining hospitals in the commonwealth with rods over the next two years approximately an additional 170 hospitals . in december 2002 the rods laboratory released version 1.1 of the rods software to the public. the release includes all of the components necessary to deploy rods for clinic visits surveillance. rods is free for noncommercial use and can be downloaded at http www.health.pitt.edu rods sw . although the software has been downloaded in excess of 170 times we are aware of only a few successful efforts at deployment. these kinds of systems require network engineers oracle database administrators and interface engineers and very few health departments have access to that skills set. for these reasons we have moved to an application service provider model for dissemination in which we encourage state and local health departments to form coalitions to support shared services. we also have been fortunate to have sufficient grant funding from the commonwealth of pennsylvania to be able to support these services on an interim basis while sustainable funding models evolve. our original design objectives for rods were real-time collection of data with sufficient geographic coverage and sampling density to provide early syndromic warning of a large-scale aerosol release of anthrax. although we have not achieved all of our initial design objectives progress has been substantial. the research identified two types of data free-text chief complaints and sales of otc health care products that can be obtained in real time or near real time at sampling levels of 70 or higher for most of the united states. these results were obtained through large-scale deployments of rods in pennsylvania and utah and through building the national retail data monitor described in the accompanying article in this issue of jamia. the deployments also provided insights about organizational and technical success factors that would inform an effort to scale the project nationally. the project established the importance of hl7 message routers also known as integration engines for public health surveillance. hl7 message routers are a mature highly prevalent technology in health care. we demonstrated that free-text triage chief complaints can be obtained in real time from most u.s. hospitals through message routers and that these data represent early syndromal information about disease. many other clinical data of value to public health are transmitted using the hl7 standard e.g. orders for diagnostic tests especially microbiology tests reports of chest radiographs medications and test results and can be integrated into rods or other surveillance systems capable of receiving hl7 messages. as a result of our efforts to disseminate this technology by giving it away we have learned that most health departments do not have the technical resources to build and maintain real-time electronic disease surveillance systems. our application service provider model has been much more successful and we now recommend that states form coalitions to share the costs of such services. the project very early identified the need for a computing component to reside within the firewall of a health system connected to the hospital's hl7 message router. this component would function as a case detector in a distributed public health surveillance scheme linking laboratory and radiology data to increase the specificity of case detection. it has proven very difficult to disseminate this technology perhaps due to the complexity of the idea. nevertheless the threat of bioterrorism has created a need for such technology and this approach or something with equivalent function must be deployed. adherence to nedss architectural standards was an early design objective that we have met. rods 1.5 closely follows nedss architectural software messaging and data specifications. our success is a strong validation of those standards. we will gain further understanding of the standards as we attempt to use rods components including hl7 listeners natural language parsers message parsers databases user interfaces notification subsystems and detection algorithms with other nedss compliant systems. an ongoing project will use rods to collect chief complaints and integrate them into the utah department of health's planned nedss system. we have demonstrated the ability to rapidly deploy rods in a special event with the added advantage that the system persisted after the event. this experience suggests strongly that rods or similar systems be considered an alternative to drop-in surveillance. our future plans are to meet our initial design objective to develop early-warning capability for a large outdoor release of anthrax especially ensuring that the data and analysis produced by rods are reviewed by public health. this goal will require improvements in the interfaces and the detection algorithms to reduce false alarms and to vastly improve the efficiency with which anomalies are evaluated by use of multiple types of data better interfaces and implementation of the look-back function. we would like to enlarge as quickly as possible the application service provider to include more states and more types of clinical data so that states will be in a position to prospectively evaluate the detection performance from different types of data on naturally occurring outbreaks. our long-term goals are to add additional disease scenarios to the design objectives such as detection of in-building anthrax release vector-borne disease food-borne disease and a communicable disease such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars . rods is a nedss-compliant public health surveillance system that focuses on real-time collection and analysis of data routinely collected for other purposes. rods is deployed in two states and was installed quickly in seven weeks for the 2002 olympics. our experience demonstrates the feasibility of such a surveillance system and the challenges involved. outbreaks emerging infections and bioterrorism have become serious threats. it is our hope that the front-line of public health workers astute citizens and health care workers will detect outbreaks early enough so that systems such as rods are not needed. however timely outbreak detection is too important to be left to human detection alone. the notion that public health can operate optimally without timely electronic information is as unwise as having commercial airline pilots taking off without weather forecasts and radar.\", 'combined': \"technical description of rods a real-time public health surveillance system this report describes the design and implementation of the real-time outbreak and disease surveillance rods system a computer-based public health surveillance system for early detection of disease outbreaks. hospitals send rods data from clinical encounters over virtual private networks and leased lines using the health level 7 hl7 message protocol. the data are sent in real time. rods automatically classifies the registration chief complaint from the visit into one of seven syndrome categories using bayesian classifiers. it stores the data in a relational database aggregates the data for analysis using data warehousing techniques applies univariate and multivariate statistical detection algorithms to the data and alerts users of when the algorithms identify anomalous patterns in the syndrome counts. rods also has a web-based user interface that supports temporal and spatial analyses. rods processes sales of over-the-counter health care products in a similar manner but receives such data in batch mode on a daily basis. rods was used during the 2002 winter olympics and currently operates in two states pennsylvania and utah. it has been and continues to be a resource for implementing evaluating and applying new methods of public health surveillance. the role of public health surveillance is to collect analyze and interpret data about biological agents diseases risk factors and other health events and to provide timely dissemination of collected information to decision makers.17 conventionally public health surveillance relies on manual operations and off-line analysis. existing syndromic surveillance systems include the cdc's drop-in surveillance systems 8 early notification of community-based epidemics essence 10 18 the lightweight epidemiology advanced detection and emergency response system leaders 19 the rapid syndrome validation project rsvp 20 and the eight systems discussed by lober et al.11 lober et al. summarized desirable characteristics of syndromic surveillance systems and analyzed the extent to which systems that were in existence in 2001 had those characteristics.11 a limitation of most systems e.g. essence 10 children's hospital in boston 11 university of washington11 was batch transfer of data which may delay detection by as long as the time interval periodicity between batch transfers. for example a surveillance system with daily batch transfer may delay by one day the detection of an outbreak. some systems required manual data input e.g. cdc's drop-in surveillance systems rsvp 20 and leaders19 which is labor-intensive and in the worst case requires round-the-clock staffing. manual data input is not a feasible mid- or long-term solution even if the approach is to add items to existing encounter forms where the items still may be ignored by busy clinicians . a third limitation for existing surveillance systems is that the systems may not exploit existing standards or communication protocols like heath level 7 hl7 even when they are available. the data type most commonly used among surveillance systems is symptoms or diagnoses of patients from ed and or physician office visits. other types of data identified in that study include emergency call center and nurse advice lines. other types of data being used include sales of over-the-counter health care products prescriptions telephone call volumes to health care providers and drug stores and absenteeism. we have conducted studies demonstrating that the free-text chief complaint data that we use correlate with outbreaks.21 22 the overall design objective for rods is similar to that of an early warning system for missile defense namely to collect whatever data are required to achieve early detection from as wide an area as necessary and to analyze the data in a way that they can be used effectively by decision makers. it is required that this analysis be done in close to real time. this design objective is complex and difficult to operationalize because of the large number of organisms and the even larger number of possible routes of dissemination all requiring potentially different types of data for their detection different algorithms and different time urgencies. for this reason our focus since beginning the project in 1999 has been on the specific problem of detecting a large-scale outbreak due to an outdoor outside buildings aerosol release of anthrax. additional design objectives were adherence to nedss standards to ensure future interoperability with other types of public health surveillance systems scalability and that the system could not rely on manual data entry except when it was done in a focused way in response to the system's own analysis of passively collected data. rods uses clinical data that are already being collected by health care providers and systems during the registration process. when a patient arrives at an ed or an instacare in utah the registration clerk or triage nurse elicits the patient's reason for visit i.e. the chief complaint age gender home zip code and other data and enter the data in a registration computer. the registration computer then generates an hl7 adt admission discharge and transfer message and transmits it to the health system's hl7 message router also called an integration engine . there usually is only one message router per health system even if there are many hospitals and facilities. these processes are all routine existing business activities and do not need to be created de novo for public health surveillance. shows the flow of clinical data to and within rods. the hospital's hl7 message router

available for free download at http health.pitt.edu rods sw . over the course of the project rods has used two detection algorithms. these algorithms have not been formally field tested because the emphasis of the project to date has been on developing the data collection infrastructure more than field testing of algorithms. the recursive-least-square rls adaptive filter28 currently runs every four hours and alerts are sent to public health officials in utah and pennsylvania. rls a dynamic autoregressive linear model computes an expected count for each syndrome category for seven counties in utah and 16 counties in pennsylvania as well as for the combined counts for each state. we use rls because it has a minimal reliance on historical data for setting model parameters and a high sensitivity to rapid increases in a time series e.g. a sudden increase in daily counts. rls triggers an alert when the current actual count exceeds the 95 confidence interval for the predicted count. during the 2002 olympics we also used the what's strange about recent events wsare 1.0 algorithm.29 wsare performs a heuristic search over combinations of temporal and spatial features to detect anomalous densities of cases in space and time. such features include all aspects of recent patient records including syndromal categories age gender and geographical information about patients. the criteria used in the past for sending a wsare 1.0 alert was that there has been an increase in the number of patients with specific characteristics relative to the counts on the same day of the week during recent weeks and the p-value after careful adjustment for multiple testing for the increase was 0.05. version 3.0 of wsare which will incorporate a bayesian model for computing expected counts rather than using unadjusted historical counts currently is under development. when an algorithm triggers an alert based on the above criteria rods sends e-mail and or page alerts to its users. rods uses an xml-based configuration file to define users' e-mail and pager addresses. the e-mail version of the alert includes a url link to a graph of the time series that triggered the alarm with two comparison time series total visits for the same time period and normalized counts. rods has a password-protected encrypted web site at which users can review health care registration and sales of otc health care products on epidemic plots and maps. when a user logs in rods will check the user's profile and will display data only for his or her health department's jurisdiction. the interface comprises three screens main epiplot and mapplot. the main screen alternates views automatically among each of the available data sources currently health care registrations and otc products in pennsylvania and utah and otc sales only for other states . the view alternates every two minutes as shown in . the clinic visits view shows daily total visits and seven daily syndromes for the past week. the otc data view shows daily sales for five product categories and the total also for the past week. users also can set the view to a specific county in a state. if the normalize control box is checked the counts in the time series being displayed will be divided by normalized by the total daily sales of otc health care products or ed visits for the region. the epiplot screen provides a general epidemic plotting capability. the user can simultaneously view a mixture of different syndromes and otc product categories for any geographic region state county or zip code and for any time interval. the user also can retrieve case details as shown in . the get cases button queries the database for the admission date age zip code and chief complaint verbatim not classified into syndrome category of all patients in the time interval and typically is used to examine an anomalous density spike of cases. the download data button will download data as a compressed comma separated file for further analyses. the mapplot screen is an interface to arcims an internet-enabled gis product developed by environmental systems research institute inc. mapplot colors zip code regions to indicate the proportion of patients presenting with a particular syndrome. the gis server also can overlay state boundaries county boundaries water bodies hospital locations landmarks streets and highways on the public health data as shown in . similar to epiplot mapplot also can display case details for a user-selected zip code. rods has been in operation for four years and like most production systems has acquired many fault-tolerant features. for example at the software level hl7 listeners continue to receive messages and temporarily store the messages when the database is off-line. a data manager program runs every ten minutes and on finding such a cache it loads the unstored messages to the database when the database is back on-line. in addition the data manager program monitors and restarts hl7 listeners as necessary. the database uses archive log mode to log every transaction to ensure that the database can recover from a system failure. the hardware architecture also is fault tolerant. all servers have dual power supplies and dual network cards. all hard drives use redundant arrays of inexpensive disk configurations. in addition to dual power supplies all machines are connected to an uninterrupted power supply that is capable of sending an e-mail alert to the rods administrator when the main power is down. an important component of rods that currently is used only at the upmc health system in pittsburgh is the health system resident component hsrc . the hsrc is located within the firewall of a health system and connects directly to the hl7 message router. the hsrc currently receives a diverse set of clinical data from the hl7 message router including culture results radiology reports and dictated emergency room notes. its purpose is to provide additional public health surveillance functions that would not be possible if it were located outside of the firewall due to restrictions on the release of identifiable clinical data. the hsrc uses patient identifiers to link laboratory and radiology information to perform case detection. in the past we have used hsrc to monitor for patients with both a gram-positive rod in a preliminary microbiology culture report and mediastinal widening in a radiology report. the hsrc is a case detector in a distributed outbreak detection system that is capable of achieving much higher specificity of patient diagnostic categorization through access to more information. hsrc also removes identifiable information before transmitting data to the rods system a function provided by the health system's message router in other hospitals that connect to rods. the hsrc at upmc health system functions as an electronic laboratory reporting system although the state and local health departments are not yet ready to receive real-time messaging from the system. currently it sends email alerts to the director of the laboratory and hospital infection control group about positive cultures for organisms that are required to be reported to public health in the state of pennsylvania.30 it also sends messages to hospital infection control when it detects organisms that cause nosocomial infections. these organisms include clostridium difficile methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. we have been able in hsrc to prototype one additional feature which is a look-back function that facilitates very rapid outbreak investigations by providing access to electronic medical records to public health investigators as shown in . this feature requires a token that can be passed to a hospital information system that can uniquely identify a patient and the reason we have prototyped this feature in the hsrc and not in rods is simply that hsrc runs within the firewall so an unencrypted token can be used. the look-back is accomplished as follows when a public health user identifies an anonymous patient record of interest e.g. one of 20 patients with diarrhea today from one zip code hsrc calls the upmc health system web-based electronic medical record system and passes it the patient identifier. upmc health system then requests the user to log in using the upmc-issued password before providing access to the record directly from its own secure web site. this approach is not intended to be implemented in hsrc but rather in the rods system outside of the firewall of a health system. it is intended to use encrypted identifiers that the health system would decrypt to retrieve the correct record. the hsrc could provide the encryption-decryption service or it could be provided by another data system in the hospital. we estimate that the prevalence of health systems that have web-based results review in the united states is 30 to 50 and growing so that this approach could very quickly improve the efficiency of outbreak investigations. rods has been in operation in pennsylvania since 1999 and in utah since january 2002. in utah rods receives data from two health systems intermountain heath care including nine eds and 18 acute care facilities and the university of utah health sciences center with one ed.24 together these facilities serve about 70 of the population of utah. in pennsylvania rods receives data from 20 health systems comprising 38 hospitals. two health systems each with one hospital send plain text files to rods on a daily basis. in pennsylvania rods covers 80 of ed visits in allegheny county population 1.3 m where pittsburgh is located 50 of visits in the 13-county metropolitan medical response area centered on pittsburgh population 3.0 m and more than 70 coverage of three other counties including dauphin county where harrisburg the capital of pennsylvania is located. the commonwealth of pennsylvania is funding a large project to connect the remaining hospitals in the commonwealth with rods over the next two years approximately an additional 170 hospitals . in december 2002 the rods laboratory released version 1.1 of the rods software to the public. the release includes all of the components necessary to deploy rods for clinic visits surveillance. rods is free for noncommercial use and can be downloaded at http www.health.pitt.edu rods sw . although the software has been downloaded in excess of 170 times we are aware of only a few successful efforts at deployment. these kinds of systems require network engineers oracle database administrators and interface engineers and very few health departments have access to that skills set. for these reasons we have moved to an application service provider model for dissemination in which we encourage state and local health departments to form coalitions to support shared services. we also have been fortunate to have sufficient grant funding from the commonwealth of pennsylvania to be able to support these services on an interim basis while sustainable funding models evolve. our original design objectives for rods were real-time collection of data with sufficient geographic coverage and sampling density to provide early syndromic warning of a large-scale aerosol release of anthrax. although we have not achieved all of our initial design objectives progress has been substantial. the research identified two types of data free-text chief complaints and sales of otc health care products that can be obtained in real time or near real time at sampling levels of 70 or higher for most of the united states. these results were obtained through large-scale deployments of rods in pennsylvania and utah and through building the national retail data monitor described in the accompanying article in this issue of jamia. the deployments also provided insights about organizational and technical success factors that would inform an effort to scale the project nationally. the project established the importance of hl7 message routers also known as integration engines for public health surveillance. hl7 message routers are a mature highly prevalent technology in health care. we demonstrated that free-text triage chief complaints can be obtained in real time from most u.s. hospitals through message routers and that these data represent early syndromal information about disease. many other clinical data of value to public health are transmitted using the hl7 standard e.g. orders for diagnostic tests especially microbiology tests reports of chest radiographs medications and test results and can be integrated into rods or other surveillance systems capable of receiving hl7 messages. as a result of our efforts to disseminate this technology by giving it away we have learned that most health departments do not have the technical resources to build and maintain real-time electronic disease surveillance systems. our application service provider model has been much more successful and we now recommend that states form coalitions to share the costs of such services. the project very early identified the need for a computing component to reside within the firewall of a health system connected to the hospital's hl7 message router. this component would function as a case detector in a distributed public health surveillance scheme linking laboratory and radiology data to increase the specificity of case detection. it has proven very difficult to disseminate this technology perhaps due to the complexity of the idea. nevertheless the threat of bioterrorism has created a need for such technology and this approach or something with equivalent function must be deployed. adherence to nedss architectural standards was an early design objective that we have met. rods 1.5 closely follows nedss architectural software messaging and data specifications. our success is a strong validation of those standards. we will gain further understanding of the standards as we attempt to use rods components including hl7 listeners natural language parsers message parsers databases user interfaces notification subsystems and detection algorithms with other nedss compliant systems. an ongoing project will use rods to collect chief complaints and integrate them into the utah department of health's planned nedss system. we have demonstrated the ability to rapidly deploy rods in a special event with the added advantage that the system persisted after the event. this experience suggests strongly that rods or similar systems be considered an alternative to drop-in surveillance. our future plans are to meet our initial design objective to develop early-warning capability for a large outdoor release of anthrax especially ensuring that the data and analysis produced by rods are reviewed by public health. this goal will require improvements in the interfaces and the detection algorithms to reduce false alarms and to vastly improve the efficiency with which anomalies are evaluated by use of multiple types of data better interfaces and implementation of the look-back function. we would like to enlarge as quickly as possible the application service provider to include more states and more types of clinical data so that states will be in a position to prospectively evaluate the detection performance from different types of data on naturally occurring outbreaks. our long-term goals are to add additional disease scenarios to the design objectives such as detection of in-building anthrax release vector-borne disease food-borne disease and a communicable disease such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars . rods is a nedss-compliant public health surveillance system that focuses on real-time collection and analysis of data routinely collected for other purposes. rods is deployed in two states and was installed quickly in seven weeks for the 2002 olympics. our experience demonstrates the feasibility of such a surveillance system and the challenges involved. outbreaks emerging infections and bioterrorism have become serious threats. it is our hope that the front-line of public health workers astute citizens and health care workers will detect outbreaks early enough so that systems such as rods are not needed. however timely outbreak detection is too important to be left to human detection alone. the notion that public health can operate optimally without timely electronic information is as unwise as having commercial airline pilots taking off without weather forecasts and radar.\"}}\n",

frameshift effici quantifi describ ivanov 1998a'}, 'biobert': {'title': 'conservation of polyamine regulation by translational frameshifting from yeast to mammals', 'abstract': 'regulation of ornithine decarboxylase in vertebrates involves a negative feedback mechanism requiring the protein antizyme. here we show that a similar mechanism exists in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe. the expression of mammalian antizyme genes requires a specific 1 translational frameshift. the efficiency of the frameshift event reflects cellular polyamine levels creating the autoregulatory feedback loop. as shown here the yeast antizyme gene and several newly identified antizyme genes from different nematodes also require a ribosomal frameshift event for their expression. twelve nucleotides around the frameshift site are identical between s.pombe and the mammalian counterparts. the core element for this frameshifting is likely to have been present in the last common ancestor of yeast nematodes and mammals.', 'body': 'the efficiency of 1 ribosomal frameshifting at a specific codon is used as a sensor to regulate polyamine levels in mammalian cells. the frameshifting occurs in decoding the gene antizyme 1 which has two partially overlapping open reading frames orfs . protein sequencing showed that the reading-frame shift occurs at the last codon of orf1 causing a proportion of ribosomes to enter orf2 to synthesize a transframe protein matsufuji et al. 1995 . orf2 encodes the main functional domains matsufuji et al. 1990 miyazaki et al. 1992 of antizyme but has no ribosome initiation site of its own. the antizyme 1 protein binds to ornithine decarboxylase odc murakami et al. 1992a li and coffino 1993 1994 inhibits it heller et al. 1976 and targets it for degradation by the 26s proteosome without ubiquitylation murakami et al. 1992b 1999 . odc catalyzes the first and usually rate-limiting step in the synthesis of polyamines conversion of ornithine to putrescine. putrescine is a substrate for the synthesis of spermidine and spermine. because of its inhibition of odc antizyme 1 is a negative regulator of the synthesis of polyamines. in addition antizyme 1 is a negative regulator of the polyamine transporter mitchell et al. 1994 suzuki et al. 1994 sakata et al. 1997 . as discovered by matsufuji and colleagues gesteland et al. 1992 and rom and kahana 1994 increasing polyamine levels elevate frameshifting in decoding antizyme 1 mrna and so increase the level of antizyme 1. since antizyme 1 negatively regulates the synthesis and uptake of polyamines the frameshifting is the sensor for an autoregulatory circuit. a second mammalian paralog of antizyme antizyme 2 has very similar properties to antizyme 1 including the regulatory frameshifting but does not stimulate degradation of odc under certain conditions where antizyme 1 is active ivanov et al. 1998a zhu et al. 1999 y.murakami s.matsufuji i.p.ivanov r.f.gesteland and j.f.atkins in preparation . just like antizyme 1 antizyme 2 mrna is ubiquitously expressed in the body but is 16 times less abundant than mrna of antizyme 1 ivanov et al. 1998a . in addition to antizyme 1 and 2 mammals have a third paralog of the gene antizyme 3 also encoded by two orfs which is expressed only during spermatogenesis ivanov et al. 2000 . zebrafish also have multiple antizyme genes which differ in their expression patterns and activities saito et al. 2000 . numerous studies have addressed the regulation of fungal odc in response to exogenously added polyamines. in the cases examined physarum polycephalum mitchell and wilson 1983 saccharomyces cerevisiae fonzi 1989 toth and coffino 1999 and neurospora crassa barnett et al. 1988 williams et al. 1992 added polyamines especially spermidine result in significant repression of odc activity. the mechanisms of repression seem to vary from fungus to fungus and are apparently different from the mechanism of polyamine-dependent regulation of odc in higher eukaryotes. in some cases the existence of an antizyme-like protein has been suggested but has either been disproved as in the case of n.crassa barnett et al. 1988 or has never been substantiated as is the case with s.cerevisiae. as expected from their small cationic nature and ability to neutralize negative charges locally polyamines play key roles in processes ranging from the functioning of certain ion channels williams 1997 nucleic acid packaging dna replication apoptosis transcription and translation. the role of polyamines can be complex as illustrated by the transfer of the butylamine moiety of spermidine to a lysine residue to form hypusine in mammalian translation initiation factor eif-5a the only known substrate for this reaction tome et al. 1997 lee et al. 1999 . spermine negatively regulates the growth of prostatic carcinoma cells at their primary site smith et al. 1995 but at later stages of tumor progression it fails to induce antizyme which correlates with cells becoming refractory to spermine koike et al. 1999 . lack of antizyme function is also important in the early de-regulation of cellular proliferation in oral tumors tsuji et al. 1998 and probably others. the levels of polyamines are altered in many tumors and inhibitors of polyamine synthesis are being tested for antiproliferative and cell death effects. the synthesis of odc varies during the cell cycle in normal cells linden et al. 1985 fredlund et al. 1995 . it is induced by many growth stimuli and is constitutively elevated in transformed cells pegg 1988 auvinen et al. 1992 with some phosphorylated odc being translocated to the surface membrane where it is important for mitotic cytoskeleton rearrangement events heiskala et al. 1999 . antizyme is one example of certain mrna-contained signals that can elevate specific frameshifting 1000-fold above the background level of normal translational errors. in addition to antizyme frameshifting is also involved in the decoding of some bacterial and yeast genes and especially in many mammalian retroviruses and coronaviruses plant viruses and bacterial insertion sequences atkins et al. 1999 . the site of frameshifting in both mammalian antizyme 1 and 2 mrnas is ucc uga where quadruplet translocation occurs at uccu underlined to shift reading to the 1 frame immediately before the uga stop codon of the initiating frame matsufuji et al. 1995 ivanov et al. 1998a . for the frameshifting to occur with an efficiency of 20 or more it is important that the 3 base of the quadruplet is the first base of a stop codon. other important features are a pseudoknot just 3 of the shift site and a specific sequence 5 of the shift site matsufuji et al. 1995 ivanov et al. 1998a . a pseudoknot 3 of the shift site is a common stimulator for eukaryotic 1 frameshifting but the synthesis of antizyme is the only known case utilizing 1 frameshifting. comparative analysis of rna sequences from different organisms is informative about important features and the different options selected by evolution. since most of the known examples of programmed frameshifting are in viruses or chromosomal mobile elements the opportunity for comparison of frameshift cassettes in divergent organisms where the time of divergence can be approximated is limited. a start has been made with the frameshifting required for bacterial release factor 2 expression persson and atkins 1998 but antizyme provides the first opportunity for such a comparison in eukaryotes. antizyme genes in genetically tractable lower eukaryotes would be helpful for understanding the functionally important interactions responsible for autoregulatory programmed frameshifting. a search for dna sequences encoding protein sequences homologous to drosophila melanogaster antizyme ivanov et al. 1998b and homo sapiens antizyme 1 identified the same s.pombe anonymous cdna clone ddbj embl genbank accession no. d89228 . the similarity is limited 10 identity 24 similarity to both human antizyme 1 and d.melanogaster antizyme however it is highest in regions that are most highly conserved among the previously identified antizymes figure 1a . closer examination of the cdna nucleotide sequence provided further evidence that it encodes an s.pombe homolog of antizyme. the initiating aug codon for the orf that is similar to higher eukaryotic antizymes orf2 of those genes is not the 5 -most aug in this cdna. in fact there are eight augs closer to the 5 end. the first or the second augs would initiate translation of an orf orf1 that overlaps the longer downstream orf orf2 such that a 1 translational frameshifting event in the overlap would generate a protein product analogous to the products of antizyme genes from higher eukaryotes. furthermore the last 12 nucleotides of orf1 ugg-ugc-ucc-uga are identical to the last 12 nucleotides of mammalian antizyme 1 orf1s including the frameshift site. eleven of these 12 nucleotides are identical to the corresponding regions of all previously identified antizyme genes figure 1b . previous experiments with the mammalian frameshift sequence tested in s.pombe have shown that this short 12 nucleotide sequence by itself is sufficient to stimulate measurable levels up to 0.5 of 1 frameshifting ivanov et al. 1998c . to confirm the orf configuration of the putative s.pombe antizyme gene a region corresponding to the two overlapping orfs plus 80 nucleotides of the 5 utr and 370 nucleotides of the 3 utr was amplified from both s.pombe genomic dna and a cdna library. the sequence of the amplified dna confirmed that there are indeed two overlapping orfs with the deduced configuration. this sequence ddbj embl genbank accession no. af217277 differs from the previously sequenced cdna clone by three nucleotides two in the coding region and one in the 3 utr one changes an alanine codon to proline another is a silent mutation within a proline codon. since the sequences from the cdna library and genomic dna are identical we conclude that the differences with clone no. d89228 are most likely due to strain variation. this gene contains no introns within the amplified region. the s.pombe protein was tested for antizyme activity using a gene fusion with glutathione s-transferase gst . in this construct orf1 and orf2 of antizyme are fused in-frame by deleting the t nucleotide that encodes u of the stop codon of orf1. this gst antizyme fusion gene was expressed in escherichia coli and the protein was purified by affinity chromatography. odc inhibitory activity was tested by incubating the recombinant antizyme protein with an s.pombe crude extract and then assaying the mixture for odc activity. the results figure 2 show that the recombinant protein can inhibit s.pombe odc. gst alone 1 µg does not inhibit s.pombe odc data not shown . in light of these results the s.pombe gene will be called s.pombe odc antizyme spa . interestingly the s.pombe odc was also inhibited by mouse antizyme 1 and antizyme 2 both expressed as gst fusions however the yeast fusion protein did not inhibit mouse odc data not shown . although the effects of overexpression of antizyme on cellular physiology have been tested previously in mammalian cells the physiological changes associated with complete absence of antizyme activity have not yet been investigated because of the complication of multiple antizymes. the single s.pombe antizyme provides the chance to explore a knockout. spa deletion strains were generated by replacing the two orfs of the gene with the orfs of either ura4 or leu2 see materials and methods . complete deletion of spa both orfs did not affect the viability of s.pombe cells in rich ye or minimal mm media. temperature had no differential effect on mutant and wild-type cell growth. similarly the growth rates mating efficiencies and overall morphology of the knockout strains are apparently indistinguishable from those of wild-type cells results not shown . in wild-type s.pombe cells the most abundant polyamine is spermidine followed by putrescine figure 3 . spermine and cadaverine are found in much smaller amounts. this distribution of polyamine content is very similar to that in other fungi for which polyamine concentrations have been measured for references see review by tabor and tabor 1985 . the effect of spa deletion on cellular polyamine contents was examined in both exponentially growing and stationary phase cells figure 3 . the cellular concentrations of putrescine spermidine and cadaverine but not spermine were higher in the knockout strains than in wild-type cells. the greatest effect was seen on putrescine and cadaverine content with smaller effects on spermidine presumably because eukaryotic odc activity directly catalyzes decarboxylation of both ornithine and lysine to produce putrescine and cadaverine respectively pegg and mcgill 1979 but subsequent regulatory events affect homeostasis of spermidine and spermine. the effect of inactivating antizyme on the polyamine contents in exponentially growing cells is modest 2-fold in all cases . the effect becomes very pronounced in cells in stationary phase with up to 40- and 10-fold increases of putrescine and cadaverine contents respectively in the knockout strains. to test overexpression of spa two versions of the gene were cloned into prep3 expression vector behind a strong thiamine-repressible promoter nmt1 . one had the wild-type spa sequence while in the second orf1 and orf2 are fused in-frame. spa wild type and an spa deletion strain were transformed with each of the overexpression constructs. derepression of the nmt1 promoter is a gradual process since it requires dilution of the intracellular pool of thiamine the repressor through cell division. after 2.5 days of exponential growth under derepressed conditions yeast strains transformed with either spa overexpression construct show significant increases in doubling time figure 4a . the growth inhibition is greater with the construct expressing the in-frame version of spa and after prolonged incubation 5 7 days these cells cease growth and accumulate in g1 as determined by flow cytometry data not shown . the fact that the in-frame overexpression construct which differs by a single nucleotide from the wild-type construct confers a more severe phenotype is consistent with the hypothesis that translational frameshifting is required for expression of spa. the growth phenotype associated with spa overexpression is only partially relieved by adding 100 µm putrescine to the media 1 mm had no further effect data not shown . to see whether the slower growth is correlated with aberrant polyamine levels the polyamine contents of the deletion strain carrying in-frame spa overexpression vector were measured under derepressed and repressed conditions in both cases after 2 days of exponential growth figure 4b . as expected overexpression of spa results in significant reduction in the intracellular levels of all four polyamines. after longer 4 5 days incubation under derepressed conditions no putrescine and cadaverine can be detected data not shown . previously we developed an assay for measuring antizyme translational frameshifting in both s.cerevisiae matsufuji et al. 1996 and s.pombe ivanov et al. 1998c . briefly the nucleotide sequence to be assayed is inserted between gst and lacz such that orf1 of the assayed sequence is fused in-frame to gst while orf2 is fused in-frame to lacz. β-galactosidase activity provides a measure of frameshifting efficiency. to determine whether translational frameshifting occurs in the overlap of orf1 and orf2 of spa a region of spa including all but the first codon of orf1 plus 180 nucleotides downstream of the orf1 stop codon was tested. 1 frameshifting occurred at 2.2 compared with a construct in which orf1 and orf2 are fused in-frame. this result is consistent with 1 frameshifting being crucial for expression of spa. previous experiments have shown that the frameshift cassette of mammalian antizyme 1 can direct efficient 1 frameshifting when tested in s.pombe. the reverse experiment was conducted here. the spa gene was translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and its resulting frameshift efficiency measured. with no addition of polyamines frameshifting efficiency is 1.5 . addition of spermidine to the translation mixture to a final concentration of 1 mm results in a 3.7-fold increase in frameshifting to 5.5 a level even higher than that observed in the endogenous system in vivo autoradiogram not shown . the observed efficiency of frameshifting with the spa frameshifting cassette in vivo in s.pombe is significantly more than that expected from its limited nucleotide similarity to the antizyme frameshift sites of higher eukaryotes. this prompted a search for additional stimulatory elements within the spa frameshift cassette. the following experiments were done in a strain carrying deletion of spa high polyamines because it gives higher frameshifting and higher β-galactosidase activity in general however we obtained similar ratios for mutant to wild-type frameshifting efficiency in a strain with the intact spa gene. deleting 5 sequences up to the third to last sense codon of orf1 has little or no effect on frameshifting efficiency. deleting all but the last sense codon ucc of orf1 leads to a 4- to 5-fold reduction in frameshifting efficiency figure 5a . this implies that the conservation of the six nucleotides 5 of the ucc-uga frameshift site is due to their importance for stimulating 1 frameshifting. it also suggests that no additional orf1 sequences of spa stimulate the 1 recoding event. the 180 nucleotide 3 region was searched for possible structure by computer rna folding algorithms plus visual inspection. the algorithms predicted several minimal structures in that region. 3 deletion constructs constructs del.3 3 81 3 tested the importance of any putative structure on the frameshifting efficiency. the results figure 5b and c show that all of these deletions lead to a significant 10-fold reduction in 1 frameshifting indicating the presence of a major 3 stimulatory element in the 180 nucleotide region immediately following the frameshift site of spa. however the results indicate that none of the putative rna structures in this region are sufficient for the activity of this element. several additional 3 deletions delineated the boundaries of this stimulatory element from the frameshift site to 150 and 180 nucleotides downstream since construct del.150 3 stimulates 5.5-fold more 1 frameshifting than del.129 3 150 nucleotides downstream probably contain most of the 3 stimulator . in the experiments described above two of the characteristics of the autoregulatory circuit of mammalian antizyme 1 were confirmed spa inhibition of odc and the 1 translational frameshifting. the key question left is whether the recoding event is responsive to polyamine levels in cells. as shown above overexpression of spa leads to significant reduction of polyamine levels in s.pombe. an spa strain was co-transformed with an spa wild-type overexpressing plasmid cells overexpressing wild-type spa grow slowly but continuously and a construct that monitors the 1 frameshifting from an spa frameshift sequence. the 1 frameshifting was compared with that in spa non-overexpressing cells in both cases frameshifting was measured relative to in-frame control . the results figure 6 show a significant reduction 6.5-fold in frameshifting efficiency in spa-overproducing cells that correlates with a decrease of polyamine content 4.5-fold for putrescine and 3.9-fold for spermidine . this indicates that polyamines modulate the frameshifting efficiency of spa. an alternative but less likely possibility is that spa overexpression reduces frameshifting because high levels of spa transcript titrate some factor limiting for frameshifting. the spa frameshift signals direct 2-fold more frameshifting in δspa leu2 cells 4.4 than in spa cells in both cases the measurement is done during stationary phase however the relatively high standard deviations for both measurements make it difficult to draw firm conclusions from this particular result. a search of caenorhabditis elegans expressed sequence tag est sequences with mammalian antizyme 1 sequence identified 20 clones. these sequences could be deconvoluted into a contiguous cdna sequence. primers designed on the basis of this sequence were used to pcr amplify and subclone this cdna from a c.elegans cdna library. the sequence of the subcloned cdna was confirmed ddbj embl genbank accession no. af217278 the subsequently released genomic sequence of this c.elegans gene ddbj embl genbank accession no. af040659 confirms our cdna data. the amino acid sequence deduced from the cdna sequence revealed that the longer orf has similarity to previously reported antizyme sequences overall 27 identity 39 similarity to human antizyme 1 19 identity 34 similarity to drosophila antizyme . these similarities are higher than that of spa to these two antizyme genes and again are concentrated in the regions most highly conserved among previously identified antizymes figure 1a . just like mammalian antizymes the longer orf orf2 lacks an appropriate in-frame initiation codon and expression could be provided by initiation in a short upstream overlapping orf orf1 leading to 1 ribosomal frameshifting in the overlap. the putative c.elegans antizyme frameshift site the nucleotides proximal to the end of orf1 has 18 of 26 nucleotides identical to the consensus sequence for antizyme frameshift sites figure 1b . frameshifting for expression of c.elegans antizyme was investigated in heterologous systems. two constructs containing the entire antizyme cdna one with the wild-type sequence and one with a single nucleotide deletion that fuses orf1 to orf2 in-frame in-frame control were transcribed in vitro and the rna was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. the products were examined by sds page figure 7 . the main product from both constructs has an apparent mr of 21 kda slightly greater than the predicted mr of 17.7 kda aberrant slower than expected mobility is observed with antizyme proteins from other species ivanov et al. 1998a . from the ratio of wild-type to in-frame product we estimate that the efficiency of frameshifting of c.elegans antizyme in reticulocyte lysate is 0.8 which is somewhat lower than spa frameshifting in the same system. addition of spermidine to the translation reactions almost doubles the efficiency of frameshifting to 1.5 the exact numbers are not easy to determine because of difficulty in defining background values . the frameshifting properties of c.elegans antizyme mrna were also tested in vivo in s.pombe cells. a sequence including all but the first codon of orf1 plus 180 nucleotides downstream was inserted between gst and lacz of the piu-lac plasmid. comparison of the β-galactosidase activity of cells δspa leu2 strain transformed with the wild-type construct and the in-frame control constructs indicated 3.5 1 frameshifting. from the frameshifting observed in the heterologous systems as well as the sequence considerations discussed above we conclude that expression of this c.elegans gene requires ribosomal frameshifting. searching the est database with the newly discovered c.elegans antizyme identified antizyme orthologs in four other nematode species. in two cases necator americanus and haemonchus contortus the cdna sequences in the database were sufficient to make contigs of the complete coding regions. in the other two cases onchocerca volvulus ddbj embl genbank accession no. af217279 and pristioncus pacificus ddbj embl genbank accession no. af217280 the complete cdna sequences were obtained by pcr amplifying and sequencing the full genes from cdna libraries. as with the previously identified eukaryotic antizyme genes the orf configuration of the newly found nematode orthologs implies the necessity for 1 frameshifting for synthesis of full-length protein. the c.elegans antizyme mrna frameshift site uuu-uga is unique differing from the ucc-uga of previously known antizyme mrnas. the c.elegans antizyme gene shares this feature with n.americanus and h.contortus but not with p.pacificus and o.volvulus antizymes. the phylogenetic tree of nematode antizyme protein sequences matches exactly the phylogenetic relationship blaxter 1998 of the nematodes expressing them indicating that these gene sequences are the result of divergent evolution within the nematode lineage data not shown . these results also show that the uuu-uga frameshift site evolved after the last common ancestor of p.pacificus and c.elegans but before the divergence of c.elegans n.americanus and h.contortus probably 450 500 million years ago . the ability of uuu-uga sequence to direct 1 frameshifting was further tested in a mammalian system in the context of the mammalian antizyme mrna i.e. in the presence of the 3 rna pseudoknot and 5 stimulator . a bmv-coat-protein antizyme 1 gene fusion construct which has a tcc-tga to ttt-tga substitution was transcribed and then translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. eleven percent frameshift efficiency was seen in the absence of exogenously added polyamines 2.2 times the efficiency seen with the ucc-uga transcript. the frameshift efficiency becomes 18 when 0.6 mm spermidine is added which is 1.3 times that with the wild type matsufuji et al. 1995 . similar results were obtained in cultured mammalian cos7 cells transfected with ttt-tga mutant construct the frameshift being higher than that of wild-type construct in both high- and low-polyamine conditions our unpublished results . these results demonstrate that the putative c.elegans frameshift site uuu-uga is if anything shiftier than ucc-uga in the antizyme 1 context and is subject to polyamine stimulation. the results presented show that the yeast s.pombe has a homolog of mammalian antizyme. this is the first documented example of antizyme-type regulation of odc in a lower eukaryote. deleting spa from the yeast genome has no detectable effect on viability or any other overt phenotypic effect but as expected it results in altered accumulation of polyamines in the cell. interestingly the effect is most pronounced in cells in stationary phase where the knockout cells accumulate up to 40 times more putrescine than wild-type counterparts. this compares with a 2-fold increase of putrescine in exponentially growing cells. a likely explanation for this observation is that the usual rate of ornithine decarboxylation in exponentially growing cells is close to capacity given normal concentrations of substrate enzyme and product. at the same time all newly synthesized polyamines are continuously diluted through cell growth and division at a rate that is almost identical to the rate of maximum capacity synthesis. cells in stationary phase can no longer dilute newly synthesized polyamines and more importantly lack an effective antizyme- independent mechanism of shutting off odc. this suggests that spa is the primary regulator of odc activity in s.pombe not only during cell growth short term regulation but also in non-dividing cells longer term regulation . overexpression of spa 5 7 days derepression leads to complete depletion of intracellular putrescine. this result implies that in s.pombe ornithine decarboxylation is the only source of putrescine synthesis the pathway from arginine via agmatine is not utilized . the complete depletion of cadaverine in spa overexpressing cells suggests that odc is the only enzyme in s.pombe that can decarboxylate lysine which is also the case in rat tissues pegg and mcgill 1979 . it is somewhat perplexing that addition of putrescine to the media leads to only partial relief of the growth phenotype associated with spa overexpression. there are two likely explanations. i perhaps s.pombe imports putrescine poorly. ii alternatively like the mammalian system maybe spa inhibits not only odc but also the polyamine transporter. further experiments will help to distinguish between these two models. it is unclear how widespread the antizyme gene is within the fungal kingdom. we have identified and cloned antizyme homologs from two other fission yeasts schizosaccharomyces octosporus and schizosaccharomyces japonicus and from two distantly related fungi botryotinia fuckeliana and emericella nidulans our unpublished results . the antizyme frameshift site of the latter two fungi has evolved in a unique way different from all other known antizymes but nevertheless even these two distantly related fungi have conserved the autoregulatory 1 frameshifting. the fact that the yeast s.pombe has an antizyme gene suggests the possibility that the higher eukaryotic metazoans may all have an antizyme gene. the only previously reported antizyme activity in unicellular organisms is from e.coli but recent analyses suggest that e.coli does not have a true antizyme ivanov et al. 1998d . this makes spa the first bona fide antizyme in a unicellular organism. the remarkable similarity of the core sequence important for antizyme frameshifting from s.pombe to humans could be due to convergent or divergent evolution. the near identity of this sequence in worms drosophila xenopus zebrafish and humans argues against convergent evolution as if antizyme frameshifting arose in a common ancestor perhaps more than one billion years ago. three cis-acting rna elements are known to stimulate mammalian antizyme 1 frameshifting. one is a 50 nucleotide sequence immediately 5 of the shift site matsufuji et al. 1995 our unpublished results . a second stimulator is the uga stop codon of orf1 and the third is an rna pseudoknot starting 3 nucleotides 3 of the uga stop codon. among frameshift sites of the previously identified antizymes from mammals all the way to drosophila there is substantial similarity in the sequences immediately 5 of the shift site. sixteen of the last 18 nucleotides of orf1 are completely conserved in these genes. schizosaccharomyces pombe and c.elegans antizymes have 9 of 9 and 6 of 9 14 out of 19 in o.volvulus nucleotides identical to the consensus respectively. for the 5 sequences generally the more distantly related two antizymes are the more the similarity is confined to the 3 end of that region. our spa orf1 deletion data show that mutation of nucleotides that are part of the 5 consensus sequence leads to reduced frameshifting efficiency. this is another indication that conservation of nucleotide sequence in this region is because of its importance for stimulating efficient 1 frameshifting. it is quite striking that in all antizyme gene sequences identified so far including a number of unpublished ones orf1 ends with a uga stop codon. this is particularly surprising since any of the other two stop codons can substitute for uga to stimulate antizyme 1 frameshifting although slightly less efficiently in vitro matsufuji et al. 1995 and in vivo our unpublished results . the 3 pseudoknot that stimulates frameshifting in antizyme 1 is highly conserved in all known vertebrate antizymes including mammalian antizyme 2 figure 1b . none of the invertebrate antizyme mrnas identified so far including those presented here has a sequence in the equivalent region that can be simply folded to a comparable rna structure. however sequences immediately 3 of the frameshift site are conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates. the conservation of this region between drosophila and the vertebrate counterparts has already been noted ivanov et al. 1998b . the c.elegans antizyme gene contains the sequence ygycccyca y pyrimidine in this region which is identical to the consensus. the antizyme genes from the other four nematodes also have a similar sequence figure 1b . the significance of this similarity is not clear in fact sequences in this region appear to play no role in antizyme 1 in vitro frameshifting outside of the rna pseudoknot context matsufuji et al. 1995 . only two examples are known where rna elements 3 of the frameshift site stimulate 1 frameshifting. one is the rna pseudoknot of mammalian antizyme 1 and the second is a short rna sequence immediately following the frameshift site of ty3 farabaugh et al. 1993 . additional examples would be very helpful in deciphering the role such elements play in the mechanism of 1 frameshifting. it is currently not known how many and which of the invertebrate antizyme genes contain 3 frameshift stimulators. the results presented here show that an s.pombe 3 stimulator enhances frameshifting 10-fold. this stimulator appears completely different from the 3 rna pseudoknot in vertebrates. our deletion experiments indicate that none of the predicted rna structures contained within the minimally required 3 region up to 150 180 nucleotides downstream of the frameshift site figure 5c are sufficient to confer the stimulatory effect. the spa 3 stimulator may act directly through sequence or may have an unusual rna structure involving non-watson crick base pairing. more detailed mutagenesis combined with phylogenetic analysis would be required to discern the nature of the 3 stimulator of spa. the nematode antizymes were analyzed for the presence of possible 5 or 3 stimulators flanking the core frameshift site. computer rna folding programs did not identify any potentially interesting structure. more importantly phylogenetic analysis with the five identified nematode antizymes failed to identify any conservation of primary rna sequence or for that matter potential secondary structure outside of the core region that is shared between two or more members. this could indicate that no such extra cis-acting stimulators exist in nematode antizymes or that they are located in a very different place within the mrna for example the 3 untranslated region the latter suggestion is not supported by our sequence analysis . a common mechanism for frameshifting is re-pairing of the peptidyl trna in the new reading frame. however an alternative mechanism whereby the peptidyl trna merely occludes the first base of the next codon has been documented for yeast ty3 frameshifting farabaugh et al. 1993 . results of experiments with some mutants of the mammalian antizyme 1 shift site pointed to an occlusion mechanism matsufuji et al. 1995 . however the mechanism with the wild-type ucc-uga shift site is not clear. for c.elegans antizyme the uuu-uga sequence would be an obvious candidate for a re-pairing since phe-trna could pair perfectly with uuu in both frames. but with ucc-uga the ser-trna first reading ucc could at best pair two out of three with ccu. this important problem warrants further investigation. the frameshift efficiency of spa frameshift site is lower than that observed with mammalian antizyme 1 even when both are tested in the same organism s.pombe for the frameshift efficiency of antizyme 1 cassette in s.pombe see ivanov et al. 1998c . it is possible that the observed efficiencies for s.pombe antizyme are artificially low because the constructs do not include all the cis-acting stimulatory elements. on the other hand there is no reason why a lower level of frameshifting does not correctly reflect the evolved balance with the other characteristics of the complex system such as relative protein stabilities. like other core cellular processes the antizyme polyamine regulatory scheme is conserved from yeast s.pombe to human. it is not obvious why this very special mechanism is so exquisitely preserved over vast evolutionary time. perhaps there is another whole aspect to the system that our experiments do not yet detect. from this viewpoint it would seem very important to exploit the genetics systems of s.pombe and c.elegans to understand more thoroughly the physiological effects of perturbing the antizyme system. the spa gene was amplified using the following primers 5 -caaaacaagttttcattattggttttttttaaatcaatcccc sense and 5 -cgtaaatccaatctaaatttaatcttcaactaaatcatgaaaagcctc antisense . the s.pombe cdna library used as a template in the amplification was kindly provided by r.rowley university of utah . the c.elegans antizyme gene was amplified using the following primers 5 -cccaggaattcctcgagtattttga gtataattttac sense and 5 -cggccgctcgagttagacctt gtagctcatgatg antisense . this same amplified dna was used to make the constructs for in vitro transcription and translation of c.elegans antizyme by cloning it into ptz18u plasmid using the saci and hindiii sites incorporated in the two primers. the in-frame construct was made using a two-step pcr. the cdna sequences of o.volvulus and p.pacificus antizyme genes were obtained by performing 5 and 3 race pcr with cdna libraries which were kindly provided by ralf sommer p.pacificus and susan haynes o.volvulus . the spa overexpression constructs were made by amplifying the gene with the primers 5 -gcatccgaattcccaaatccaagcatcatacgcc sense and 5 -gcatccggatccgccagtgttcttactttgaga tgc antisense and then inserting bamhi-digested product between the msci and bamhi sites of prep3 plasmid. the in-frame construct was made by two-step pcr and subsequently all in-frame spa constructs described below were made by one-step pcr using this plasmid s dna as a template. to make the constructs for frameshift assays in s.pombe dna fragments with a given nucleotide length as described in the main text were amplified from both the spa and c.elegans antizyme constructs described above. these fragments were then cloned between the kpni and bsteii sites of piu-lac plasmid ivanov et al. 1998c . the pcr primers included an ac spacer between the 5 cloning site bsteii and the antizyme sequences in order to correct the reading frame. the in vivo frameshifting assays in s.pombe strains ura4-d18 leu1-32 ade6-m216 h and δspa leu2 ura4-d18 leu1-32 ade6-m216 h were done as described ivanov et al. 1998c . the plasmid for gst spa expression was made by pcr amplifying spa all but the first codon of orf1 through the downstream orf2 from an in-frame template and cloning the product into the ecori and xhoi restriction sites of pgex-5x-3 plasmid. the antizyme frameshift site in the bmv-coat-antizyme fusion construct c3ne matsufuji et al. 1995 was mutated with a two-step pcr. to generate the two knockout strains δspa ura4 and δspa leu2 both orfs of spa were replaced exactly with the orf of either ura4 or leu2. to accomplish this two pairs of primers amplified ura4 and leu2 such that 50 60 nucleotides which normally flank the two orfs of spa flank the orfs of the two genes. the amplified dna products were gel purified and 2 µg of each were used to electroporate into ura4-d18 leu1-32 ade6-m216 h cells. ura and leu transformants were selected by growth on ura and leu media respectively. pcr screen and partial sequencing with primers flanking the regions used for the homologous recombination confirmed the spa disruptions. all dna clones were sequenced with automated sequencing machines abi 100 . schizosaccharomyces pombe odc active crude extracts were prepared as follows s.pombe strain 1519 leu1-32 h provided by r.rowley was grown to od600 0.7 in 50 ml of minimal media leu. ten milligrams of lysing enzymes sigma were added followed by continued incubation for 30 min at 30 c. cells were harvested and washed once with cold homogenization buffer 25 mm tris hcl ph 7 0.25 m sucrose 1 mm dithiothreitol dtt 20 µm pyridoxal-5-phosphate 2 mm edta then resuspended in 0.75 ml of homogenization buffer. cells were broken open and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10 000 r.p.m. for 15 min at 4 c. extracts were dialyzed overnight in dialysis buffer 25 mm tris hcl ph 7.4 1 mm dtt 20 µm pyridoxal-5-phosphate 0.1 mm edta . a volume of 25 µl of extract was used for each odc assay. odc activity was assayed by measuring the release of 14co2 from l- 1-14c ornithine amersham as described nishiyama et al. 1988 . each reaction took 1 h. pre-incubation of s.pombe extract with 0.1 mm difluoromethyl ornithine dfmo for 15 min led to 99 inhibition of 14co2 release. the cells were collected by centrifugation washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline pbs and then the pellet was frozen at 80 c until use. the pellet was resuspended in 0.1 ml of pbs. an aliquot of the suspension was mixed with an equal volume of 8 perchloric acid vortexed for 1 min kept on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 15 000 r.p.m. 4 c for 5 min. ten microliters of the supernatant were subjected to polyamine analysis using fluorometry on high-performance liquid chromatography as described previously murakami et al. 1989 . protein concentrations were determined with the bca protein assay kit pierce . the experiments with the bmv-coat-antizyme fusion constructs were performed as described previously matsufuji et al. 1995 . all other plasmid dna templates were prepared using qiagen miniprep kit and then digested with hindiii. transcripts for spa in vitro translation were made from pcr templates that had a t7 promoter incorporated into the pcr primers. linearized dna 1 µg was used as a template for in vitro transcription with ambion megashortscripttm t7 kit. the dnase-treated rnas were recovered and resuspended in 40 µl of rnase-free water. one microliter of each specified transcript suspension was used in each in vitro translation reaction 0.5 µl of 1 mm amino acid mix met 7 µl of reticulocyte lysate promega 0.5 µl of 35s met amersham to a total volume of 10 µl. the reactions were stopped by adding 1 µl of rnase 10 mg ml . the frameshift efficiencies were quantified as described ivanov et al. 1998a .', 'combined': 'conservation of polyamine regulation by translational frameshifting from yeast to mammals regulation of ornithine decarboxylase in vertebrates involves a negative feedback mechanism requiring the protein antizyme. here we show that a similar mechanism exists in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe. the expression of mammalian antizyme genes requires a specific 1 translational frameshift. the efficiency of the frameshift event reflects cellular polyamine levels creating the autoregulatory feedback loop. as shown here the yeast antizyme gene and several newly identified antizyme genes from different nematodes also require a ribosomal frameshift event for their expression. twelve nucleotides around the frameshift site are identical between s.pombe and the mammalian counterparts. the core element for this frameshifting is likely to have been present in the last common ancestor of yeast nematodes and mammals. the efficiency of 1 ribosomal frameshifting at a specific codon is used as a sensor to regulate polyamine levels in mammalian cells. the frameshifting occurs in decoding the gene antizyme 1 which has two partially overlapping open reading frames orfs . protein sequencing showed that the reading-frame shift occurs at the last codon of orf1 causing a proportion of ribosomes to enter orf2 to synthesize a transframe protein matsufuji et al. 1995 . orf2 encodes the main functional domains matsufuji et al. 1990 miyazaki et al. 1992 of antizyme but has no ribosome initiation site of its own. the antizyme 1 protein binds to ornithine decarboxylase odc murakami et al. 1992a li and coffino 1993 1994 inhibits it heller et al. 1976 and targets it for degradation by the 26s proteosome without ubiquitylation murakami et al. 1992b 1999 . odc catalyzes the first and usually rate-limiting step in the synthesis of polyamines conversion of ornithine to putrescine. putrescine is a substrate for the synthesis of spermidine and spermine. because of its inhibition of odc antizyme 1 is a negative regulator of the synthesis of polyamines. in addition antizyme 1 is a negative regulator of the polyamine transporter mitchell et al. 1994 suzuki et al. 1994 sakata et al. 1997 . as discovered by matsufuji and colleagues gesteland et al. 1992 and rom and kahana 1994 increasing polyamine levels elevate frameshifting in decoding antizyme 1 mrna and so increase the level of antizyme 1. since antizyme 1 negatively regulates the synthesis and uptake of polyamines the frameshifting is the sensor for an autoregulatory circuit. a second mammalian paralog of antizyme antizyme 2 has very similar properties to antizyme 1 including the regulatory frameshifting but does not stimulate degradation of odc under certain conditions where antizyme 1 is active ivanov et al. 1998a zhu et al. 1999 y.murakami s.matsufuji i.p.ivanov r.f.gesteland and j.f.atkins in preparation . just like antizyme 1 antizyme 2 mrna is ubiquitously expressed in the body but is 16 times less abundant than mrna of antizyme 1 ivanov et al. 1998a . in addition to antizyme 1 and 2 mammals have a third paralog of the gene antizyme 3 also encoded by two orfs which is expressed only during spermatogenesis ivanov et al. 2000 . zebrafish also have multiple antizyme genes which differ in their expression patterns and activities saito et al. 2000 . numerous studies have addressed the regulation of fungal odc in response to exogenously added polyamines. in the cases examined physarum polycephalum mitchell and wilson 1983 saccharomyces cerevisiae fonzi 1989 toth and coffino 1999 and neurospora crassa barnett et al. 1988 williams et al. 1992 added polyamines especially spermidine result in significant repression of odc activity. the mechanisms of repression seem to vary from fungus to fungus and are apparently different from the mechanism of polyamine-dependent regulation of odc in higher eukaryotes. in some cases the existence of an antizyme-like protein has been suggested but has either been disproved as in the case of n.crassa barnett et al. 1988 or has never been substantiated as is the case with s.cerevisiae. as expected from their small cationic nature and ability to neutralize negative charges locally polyamines play key roles in processes ranging from the functioning of certain ion channels williams 1997 nucleic acid packaging dna replication apoptosis transcription and translation. the role of polyamines can be complex as illustrated by the transfer of the butylamine moiety of spermidine to a lysine residue to form hypusine in mammalian translation initiation factor eif-5a the only known substrate for this reaction tome et al. 1997 lee et al. 1999 . spermine negatively regulates the growth of prostatic carcinoma cells at their primary site smith et al. 1995 but at later stages of tumor progression it fails to induce antizyme which correlates with cells becoming refractory to spermine koike et al. 1999 . lack of antizyme function is also important in the early de-regulation of cellular proliferation in oral tumors tsuji et al. 1998 and probably others. the levels of polyamines are altered in many tumors and inhibitors of polyamine synthesis are being tested for antiproliferative and cell death effects. the synthesis of odc varies during the cell cycle in normal cells linden et al. 1985 fredlund et al. 1995 . it is induced by many growth stimuli and is constitutively elevated in transformed cells pegg 1988 auvinen et al. 1992 with some phosphorylated odc being translocated to the surface membrane where it is important for mitotic cytoskeleton rearrangement events heiskala et al. 1999 . antizyme is one example of certain mrna-contained signals that can elevate specific frameshifting 1000-fold above the background level of normal translational errors. in addition to antizyme frameshifting is also involved in the decoding of some bacterial and yeast genes and especially in many mammalian retroviruses and coronaviruses plant viruses and bacterial insertion sequences atkins et al. 1999 . the site of frameshifting in both mammalian antizyme 1 and 2 mrnas is ucc uga where quadruplet translocation occurs at uccu underlined to shift reading to the 1 frame immediately before the uga stop codon of the initiating frame matsufuji et al. 1995 ivanov et al. 1998a . for the frameshifting to occur with an efficiency of 20 or more it is important that the 3 base of the quadruplet is the first base of a stop codon. other important features are a pseudoknot just 3 of the shift site and a specific sequence 5 of the shift site matsufuji et al. 1995 ivanov et al. 1998a . a pseudoknot 3 of the shift site is a common stimulator for eukaryotic 1 frameshifting but the synthesis of antizyme is the only known case utilizing 1 frameshifting. comparative analysis of rna sequences from different organisms is informative about important features and the different options selected by evolution. since most of the known examples of programmed frameshifting are in viruses or chromosomal mobile elements the opportunity for comparison of frameshift cassettes in divergent organisms where the time of divergence can be approximated is limited. a start has been made with the frameshifting required for bacterial release factor 2 expression persson and atkins 1998 but antizyme provides the first opportunity for such a comparison in eukaryotes. antizyme genes in genetically tractable lower eukaryotes would be helpful for understanding the functionally important interactions responsible for autoregulatory programmed frameshifting. a search for dna sequences encoding protein sequences homologous to drosophila melanogaster antizyme ivanov et al. 1998b and homo sapiens antizyme 1 identified the same s.pombe anonymous cdna clone ddbj embl genbank accession no. d89228 . the similarity is limited 10 identity 24 similarity to both human antizyme 1 and d.melanogaster antizyme however it is highest in regions that are most highly conserved among the previously identified antizymes figure 1a . closer examination of the cdna nucleotide sequence provided further evidence that it encodes an s.pombe homolog of antizyme. the initiating aug codon for the orf that is similar to higher eukaryotic antizymes orf2 of those genes is not the 5 -most aug in this cdna. in fact there are eight augs closer to the 5 end. the first or the second augs would initiate translation of an orf orf1 that overlaps the longer downstream orf orf2 such that a 1 translational frameshifting event in the overlap would generate a protein product analogous to the products of antizyme genes from higher eukaryotes. furthermore the last 12 nucleotides of orf1 ugg-ugc-ucc-uga are identical to the last 12 nucleotides of mammalian antizyme 1 orf1s including the frameshift site. eleven of these 12 nucleotides are identical to the corresponding regions of all previously identified antizyme genes figure 1b . previous experiments with the mammalian frameshift sequence tested in s.pombe have shown that this short 12 nucleotide sequence by itself is sufficient to stimulate measurable levels up to 0.5 of 1 frameshifting ivanov et al. 1998c . to confirm the orf configuration of the putative s.pombe antizyme gene a region corresponding to the two overlapping orfs plus 80 nucleotides of the 5 utr and 370 nucleotides of the 3 utr was amplified from both s.pombe genomic dna and a cdna library. the sequence of the amplified dna confirmed that there are indeed two overlapping orfs with the deduced configuration. this sequence ddbj embl genbank accession no. af217277 differs from the previously sequenced cdna clone by three nucleotides two in the coding region and one in the 3 utr one changes an alanine codon to proline another is a silent mutation within a proline codon. since the sequences from the cdna library and genomic dna are identical we conclude that the differences with clone no. d89228 are most likely due to strain variation. this gene contains no introns within the amplified region. the s.pombe protein was tested for antizyme activity using a gene fusion with glutathione s-transferase gst . in this construct orf1 and orf2 of antizyme are fused in-frame by deleting the t nucleotide that encodes u of the stop codon of orf1. this gst antizyme fusion gene was expressed in escherichia coli and the protein was purified by affinity chromatography. odc inhibitory activity was tested by incubating the recombinant antizyme protein with an s.pombe crude extract and then assaying the mixture for odc activity. the results figure 2 show that the recombinant protein can inhibit s.pombe odc. gst alone 1 µg does not inhibit s.pombe odc data not shown . in light of these results the s.pombe gene will be called s.pombe odc antizyme spa . interestingly the s.pombe odc was also inhibited by mouse antizyme 1 and antizyme 2 both expressed as gst fusions however the yeast fusion protein did not inhibit mouse odc data not shown . although the effects of overexpression of antizyme on cellular physiology have been tested previously in mammalian cells the physiological changes associated with complete absence of antizyme activity have not yet been investigated because of the complication of multiple antizymes. the single s.pombe antizyme provides the chance to explore a knockout. spa deletion strains were generated by replacing the two orfs of the gene with the orfs of either ura4 or leu2 see materials and methods . complete deletion of spa both orfs did not affect the viability of s.pombe cells in rich ye or minimal mm media. temperature had no differential effect on mutant and wild-type cell growth. similarly the growth rates mating efficiencies and overall morphology of the knockout strains are apparently indistinguishable from those of wild-type cells results not shown . in wild-type s.pombe cells the most abundant polyamine is spermidine followed by putrescine figure 3 . spermine and cadaverine are found in much smaller amounts. this distribution of polyamine content is very similar to that in other fungi for which polyamine concentrations have been measured for references see review by tabor and tabor 1985 . the effect of spa deletion on cellular polyamine contents was examined in both exponentially growing and stationary phase cells figure 3 . the cellular concentrations of putrescine spermidine and cadaverine but not spermine were higher in the knockout strains than in wild-type cells. the greatest effect was seen on putrescine and cadaverine content with smaller effects on spermidine presumably because eukaryotic odc activity directly catalyzes decarboxylation of both ornithine and lysine to produce putrescine and cadaverine respectively pegg and mcgill 1979 but subsequent regulatory events affect homeostasis of spermidine and spermine. the effect of inactivating antizyme on the polyamine contents in exponentially growing cells is modest 2-fold in all cases . the effect becomes very pronounced in cells in stationary phase with up to 40- and 10-fold increases of putrescine and cadaverine contents respectively in the knockout strains. to test overexpression of spa two versions of the gene were cloned into prep3 expression vector behind a strong thiamine-repressible promoter nmt1 . one had the wild-type spa sequence while in the second orf1 and orf2 are fused in-frame. spa wild type and an spa deletion strain were transformed with each of the overexpression constructs. derepression of the nmt1 promoter is a gradual process since it requires dilution of the intracellular pool of thiamine the repressor through cell division. after 2.5 days of exponential growth under derepressed conditions yeast strains transformed with either spa overexpression construct show significant increases in doubling time figure 4a . the growth inhibition is greater with the construct expressing the in-frame version of spa and after prolonged incubation 5 7 days these cells cease growth and accumulate in g1 as determined by flow cytometry data not shown . the fact that the in-frame overexpression construct which differs by a single nucleotide from the wild-type construct confers a more severe phenotype is consistent with the hypothesis that translational frameshifting is required for expression of spa. the growth phenotype associated with spa overexpression is only partially relieved by adding 100 µm putrescine to the media 1 mm had no further effect data not shown . to see whether the slower growth is correlated with aberrant polyamine levels the polyamine contents of the deletion strain carrying in-frame spa overexpression vector were measured under derepressed and repressed conditions in both cases after 2 days of exponential growth figure 4b . as expected overexpression of spa results in significant reduction in the intracellular levels of all four polyamines. after longer 4 5 days incubation under derepressed conditions no putrescine and cadaverine can be detected data not shown . previously we developed an assay for measuring antizyme translational frameshifting in both s.cerevisiae matsufuji et al. 1996 and s.pombe ivanov et al. 1998c . briefly the nucleotide sequence to be assayed is inserted between gst and lacz such that orf1 of the assayed sequence is fused in-frame to gst while orf2 is fused in-frame to lacz. β-galactosidase activity provides a measure of frameshifting efficiency. to determine whether translational frameshifting occurs in the overlap of orf1 and orf2 of spa a region of spa including all but the first codon of orf1 plus 180 nucleotides downstream of the orf1 stop codon was tested. 1 frameshifting occurred at 2.2 compared with a construct in which orf1 and orf2 are fused in-frame. this result is consistent with 1 frameshifting being crucial for expression of spa. previous experiments have shown that the frameshift cassette of mammalian antizyme 1 can direct efficient 1 frameshifting when tested in s.pombe. the reverse experiment was conducted here. the spa gene was translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and its resulting frameshift efficiency measured. with no addition of polyamines frameshifting efficiency is 1.5 . addition of spermidine to the translation mixture to a final concentration of 1 mm results in a 3.7-fold increase in frameshifting to 5.5 a level even higher than that observed in the endogenous system in vivo autoradiogram not shown . the observed efficiency of frameshifting with the spa frameshifting cassette in vivo in s.pombe is significantly more than that expected from its limited nucleotide similarity to the antizyme frameshift sites of higher eukaryotes. this prompted a search for additional stimulatory elements within the spa frameshift cassette. the following experiments were done in a strain carrying deletion of spa high polyamines because it gives higher frameshifting and higher β-galactosidase activity in general however we obtained similar ratios for mutant to wild-type frameshifting efficiency in a strain with the intact spa gene. deleting 5 sequences up to the third to last sense codon of orf1 has little or no effect on frameshifting efficiency. deleting all but the last sense codon ucc of orf1 leads to a 4- to 5-fold reduction in frameshifting efficiency figure 5a . this implies that the conservation of the six nucleotides 5 of the ucc-uga frameshift site is due to their importance for stimulating 1 frameshifting. it also suggests that no additional orf1 sequences of spa stimulate the 1 recoding event. the 180 nucleotide 3 region was searched for possible structure by computer rna folding algorithms plus visual inspection. the algorithms predicted several minimal structures in that region. 3 deletion constructs constructs del.3 3 81 3 tested the importance of any putative structure on the frameshifting efficiency. the results figure 5b and c show that all of these deletions lead to a significant 10-fold reduction in 1 frameshifting indicating the presence of a major 3 stimulatory element in the 180 nucleotide region immediately following the frameshift site of spa. however the results indicate that none of the putative rna structures in this region are sufficient for the activity of this element. several additional 3 deletions delineated the boundaries of this stimulatory element from the frameshift site to 150 and 180 nucleotides downstream since construct del.150 3 stimulates 5.5-fold more 1 frameshifting than del.129 3 150 nucleotides downstream probably contain most of the 3 stimulator . in the experiments described above two of the characteristics of the autoregulatory circuit of mammalian antizyme 1 were confirmed spa inhibition of odc and the 1 translational frameshifting. the key question left is whether the recoding event is responsive to polyamine levels in cells. as shown above overexpression of spa leads to significant reduction of polyamine levels in s.pombe. an spa strain was co-transformed with an spa wild-type overexpressing plasmid cells overexpressing wild-type spa grow slowly but continuously and a construct that monitors the 1 frameshifting from an spa frameshift sequence. the 1 frameshifting was compared with that in spa non-overexpressing cells in both cases frameshifting was measured relative to in-frame control . the results figure 6 show a significant reduction 6.5-fold in frameshifting efficiency in spa-overproducing cells that correlates with a decrease of polyamine content 4.5-fold for putrescine and 3.9-fold for spermidine . this indicates that polyamines modulate the frameshifting efficiency of spa. an alternative but less likely possibility is that spa overexpression reduces frameshifting because high levels of spa transcript titrate some factor limiting for frameshifting. the spa frameshift signals direct 2-fold more frameshifting in δspa leu2 cells 4.4 than in spa cells in both cases the measurement is done during stationary phase however the relatively high standard deviations for both measurements make it difficult to draw firm conclusions from this particular result. a search of caenorhabditis elegans expressed sequence tag est sequences with mammalian antizyme 1 sequence identified 20 clones. these sequences could be deconvoluted into a contiguous cdna sequence. primers designed on the basis of this sequence were used to pcr amplify and subclone this cdna from a c.elegans cdna library. the sequence of the subcloned cdna was confirmed ddbj embl genbank accession no. af217278 the subsequently released genomic sequence of this c.elegans gene ddbj embl genbank accession no. af040659 confirms our cdna data. the amino acid sequence deduced from the cdna sequence revealed that the longer orf has similarity to previously reported antizyme sequences overall 27 identity 39 similarity to human antizyme 1 19 identity 34 similarity to drosophila antizyme . these similarities are higher than that of spa to these two antizyme genes and again are concentrated in the regions most highly conserved among previously identified antizymes figure 1a . just like mammalian antizymes the longer orf orf2 lacks an appropriate in-frame initiation codon and expression could be provided by initiation in a short upstream overlapping orf orf1 leading to 1 ribosomal frameshifting in the overlap. the putative c.elegans antizyme frameshift site the nucleotides proximal to the end of orf1 has 18 of 26 nucleotides identical to the consensus sequence for antizyme frameshift sites figure 1b . frameshifting for expression of c.elegans antizyme was investigated in heterologous systems. two constructs containing the entire antizyme cdna one with the wild-type sequence and one with a single nucleotide deletion that fuses orf1 to orf2 in-frame in-frame control were transcribed in vitro and the rna was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. the products were examined by sds page figure 7 . the main product from both constructs has an apparent mr of 21 kda slightly greater than the predicted mr of 17.7 kda aberrant slower than expected mobility is observed with antizyme proteins from other species ivanov et al. 1998a . from the ratio of wild-type to in-frame product we estimate that the efficiency of frameshifting of c.elegans antizyme in reticulocyte lysate is 0.8 which is somewhat lower than spa frameshifting in the same system. addition of spermidine to the translation reactions almost doubles the efficiency of frameshifting to 1.5 the exact numbers are not easy to determine because of difficulty in defining background values . the frameshifting properties of c.elegans antizyme mrna were also tested in vivo in s.pombe cells. a sequence including all but the first codon of orf1 plus 180 nucleotides downstream was inserted between gst and lacz of the piu-lac plasmid. comparison of the β-galactosidase activity of cells δspa leu2 strain transformed with the wild-type construct and the in-frame control constructs indicated 3.5 1 frameshifting. from the frameshifting observed in the heterologous systems as well as the sequence considerations discussed above we conclude that expression of this c.elegans gene requires ribosomal frameshifting. searching the est database with the newly discovered c.elegans antizyme identified antizyme orthologs in four other nematode species. in two cases necator americanus and haemonchus contortus the cdna sequences in the database were sufficient to make contigs of the complete coding regions. in the other two cases onchocerca volvulus ddbj embl genbank accession no. af217279 and pristioncus pacificus ddbj embl genbank accession no. af217280 the complete cdna sequences were obtained by pcr amplifying and sequencing the full genes from cdna libraries. as with the previously identified eukaryotic antizyme genes the orf configuration of the newly found nematode orthologs implies the necessity for 1 frameshifting for synthesis of full-length protein. the c.elegans antizyme mrna frameshift site uuu-uga is unique differing from the ucc-uga of previously known antizyme mrnas. the c.elegans antizyme gene shares this feature with n.americanus and h.contortus but not with p.pacificus and o.volvulus antizymes. the phylogenetic tree of nematode antizyme protein sequences matches exactly the phylogenetic relationship blaxter 1998 of the nematodes expressing them indicating that these gene sequences are the result of divergent evolution within the nematode lineage data not shown . these results also show that the uuu-uga frameshift site evolved after the last common ancestor of p.pacificus and c.elegans but before the divergence of c.elegans n.americanus and h.contortus probably 450 500 million years ago . the ability of uuu-uga sequence to direct 1 frameshifting was further tested in a mammalian system in the context of the mammalian antizyme mrna i.e. in the presence of the 3 rna pseudoknot and 5 stimulator . a bmv-coat-protein antizyme 1 gene fusion construct which has a tcc-tga to ttt-tga substitution was transcribed and then translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. eleven percent frameshift efficiency was seen in the absence of exogenously added polyamines 2.2 times the efficiency seen with the ucc-uga transcript. the frameshift efficiency becomes 18 when 0.6 mm spermidine is added which is 1.3 times that with the wild type matsufuji et al. 1995 . similar results were obtained in cultured mammalian cos7 cells transfected with ttt-tga mutant construct the frameshift being higher than that of wild-type construct in both high- and low-polyamine conditions our unpublished results . these results demonstrate that the putative c.elegans frameshift site uuu-uga is if anything shiftier than ucc-uga in the antizyme 1 context and is subject to polyamine stimulation. the results presented show that the yeast s.pombe has a homolog of mammalian antizyme. this is the first documented example of antizyme-type regulation of odc in a lower eukaryote. deleting spa from the yeast genome has no detectable effect on viability or any other overt phenotypic effect but as expected it results in altered accumulation of polyamines in the cell. interestingly the effect is most pronounced in cells in stationary phase where the knockout cells accumulate up to 40 times more putrescine than wild-type counterparts. this compares with a 2-fold increase of putrescine in exponentially growing cells. a likely explanation for this observation is that the usual rate of ornithine decarboxylation in exponentially growing cells is close to capacity given normal concentrations of substrate enzyme and product. at the same time all newly synthesized polyamines are continuously diluted through cell growth and division at a rate that is almost identical to the rate of maximum capacity synthesis. cells in stationary phase can no longer dilute newly synthesized polyamines and more importantly lack an effective antizyme- independent mechanism of shutting off odc. this suggests that spa is the primary regulator of odc activity in s.pombe not only during cell growth short term regulation but also in non-dividing cells longer term regulation . overexpression of spa 5 7 days derepression leads to complete depletion of intracellular putrescine. this result implies that in s.pombe ornithine decarboxylation is the only source of putrescine synthesis the pathway from arginine via agmatine is not utilized . the complete depletion of cadaverine in spa overexpressing cells suggests that odc is the only enzyme in s.pombe that can decarboxylate lysine which is also the case in rat tissues pegg and mcgill 1979 . it is somewhat perplexing that addition of putrescine to the media leads to only partial relief of the growth phenotype associated with spa overexpression. there are two likely explanations. i perhaps s.pombe imports putrescine poorly. ii alternatively like the mammalian system maybe spa inhibits not only odc but also the polyamine transporter. further experiments will help to distinguish between these two models. it is unclear how widespread the antizyme gene is within the fungal kingdom. we have identified and cloned antizyme homologs from two other fission yeasts schizosaccharomyces octosporus and schizosaccharomyces japonicus and from two distantly related fungi botryotinia fuckeliana and emericella nidulans our unpublished results . the antizyme frameshift site of the latter two fungi has evolved in a unique way different from all other known antizymes but nevertheless even these two distantly related fungi have conserved the autoregulatory 1 frameshifting. the fact that the yeast s.pombe has an antizyme gene suggests the possibility that the higher eukaryotic metazoans may all have an antizyme gene. the only previously reported antizyme activity in unicellular organisms is from e.coli but recent analyses suggest that e.coli does not have a true antizyme ivanov et al. 1998d . this makes spa the first bona fide antizyme in a unicellular organism. the remarkable similarity of the core sequence important for antizyme frameshifting from s.pombe to humans could be due to convergent or divergent evolution. the near identity of this sequence in worms drosophila xenopus zebrafish and humans argues against convergent evolution as if antizyme frameshifting arose in a common ancestor perhaps more than one billion years ago. three cis-acting rna elements are known to stimulate mammalian antizyme 1 frameshifting. one is a 50 nucleotide sequence immediately 5 of the shift site matsufuji et al. 1995 our unpublished results . a second stimulator is the uga stop codon of orf1 and the third is an rna pseudoknot starting 3 nucleotides 3 of the uga stop codon. among frameshift sites of the previously identified antizymes from mammals all the way to drosophila there is substantial similarity in the sequences immediately 5 of the shift site. sixteen of the last 18 nucleotides of orf1 are completely conserved in these genes. schizosaccharomyces pombe and c.elegans antizymes have 9 of 9 and 6 of 9 14 out of 19 in o.volvulus nucleotides identical to the consensus respectively. for the 5 sequences generally the more distantly related two antizymes are the more the similarity is confined to the 3 end of that region. our spa orf1 deletion data show that mutation of nucleotides that are part of the 5 consensus sequence leads to reduced frameshifting efficiency. this is another indication that conservation of nucleotide sequence in this region is because of its importance for stimulating efficient 1 frameshifting. it is quite striking that in all antizyme gene sequences identified so far including a number of unpublished ones orf1 ends with a uga stop codon. this is particularly surprising since any of the other two stop codons can substitute for uga to stimulate antizyme 1 frameshifting although slightly less efficiently in vitro matsufuji et al. 1995 and in vivo our unpublished results . the 3 pseudoknot that stimulates frameshifting in antizyme 1 is highly conserved in all known vertebrate antizymes including mammalian antizyme 2 figure 1b . none of the invertebrate antizyme mrnas identified so far including those presented here has a sequence in the equivalent region that can be simply folded to a comparable rna structure. however sequences immediately 3 of the frameshift site are conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates. the conservation of this region between drosophila and the vertebrate counterparts has already been noted ivanov et al. 1998b . the c.elegans antizyme gene contains the sequence ygycccyca y pyrimidine in this region which is identical to the consensus. the antizyme genes from the other four nematodes also have a similar sequence figure 1b . the significance of this similarity is not clear in fact sequences in this region appear to play no role in antizyme 1 in vitro frameshifting outside of the rna pseudoknot context matsufuji et al. 1995 . only two examples are known where rna elements 3 of the frameshift site stimulate 1 frameshifting. one is the rna pseudoknot of mammalian antizyme 1 and the second is a short rna sequence immediately following the frameshift site of ty3 farabaugh et al. 1993 . additional examples would be very helpful in deciphering the role such elements play in the mechanism of 1 frameshifting. it is currently not known how many and which of the invertebrate antizyme genes contain 3 frameshift stimulators. the results presented here show that an s.pombe 3 stimulator enhances frameshifting 10-fold. this stimulator appears completely different from the 3 rna pseudoknot in vertebrates. our deletion experiments indicate that none of the predicted rna structures contained within the minimally required 3 region up to 150 180 nucleotides downstream of the frameshift site figure 5c are sufficient to confer the stimulatory effect. the spa 3 stimulator may act directly through sequence or may have an unusual rna structure involving non-watson crick base pairing. more detailed mutagenesis combined with phylogenetic analysis would be required to discern the nature of the 3 stimulator of spa. the nematode antizymes were analyzed for the presence of possible 5 or 3 stimulators flanking the core frameshift site. computer rna folding programs did not identify any potentially interesting structure. more importantly phylogenetic analysis with the five identified nematode antizymes failed to identify any conservation of primary rna sequence or for that matter potential secondary structure outside of the core region that is shared between two or more members. this could indicate that no such extra cis-acting stimulators exist in nematode antizymes or that they are located in a very different place within the mrna for example the 3 untranslated region the latter suggestion is not supported by our sequence analysis . a common mechanism for frameshifting is re-pairing of the peptidyl trna in the new reading frame. however an alternative mechanism whereby the peptidyl trna merely occludes the first base of the next codon has been documented for yeast ty3 frameshifting farabaugh et al. 1993 . results of experiments with some mutants of the mammalian antizyme 1 shift site pointed to an occlusion mechanism matsufuji et al. 1995 . however the mechanism with the wild-type ucc-uga shift site is not clear. for c.elegans antizyme the uuu-uga sequence would be an obvious candidate for a re-pairing since phe-trna could pair perfectly with uuu in both frames. but with ucc-uga the ser-trna first reading ucc could at best pair two out of three with ccu. this important problem warrants further investigation. the frameshift efficiency of spa frameshift site is lower than that observed with mammalian antizyme 1 even when both are tested in the same organism s.pombe for the frameshift efficiency of antizyme 1 cassette in s.pombe see ivanov et al. 1998c . it is possible that the observed efficiencies for s.pombe antizyme are artificially low because the constructs do not include all the cis-acting stimulatory elements. on the other hand there is no reason why a lower level of frameshifting does not correctly reflect the evolved balance with the other characteristics of the complex system such as relative protein stabilities. like other core cellular processes the antizyme polyamine regulatory scheme is conserved from yeast s.pombe to human. it is not obvious why this very special mechanism is so exquisitely preserved over vast evolutionary time. perhaps there is another whole aspect to the system that our experiments do not yet detect. from this viewpoint it would seem very important to exploit the genetics systems of s.pombe and c.elegans to understand more thoroughly the physiological effects of perturbing the antizyme system. the spa gene was amplified using the following primers 5 -caaaacaagttttcattattggttttttttaaatcaatcccc sense and 5 -cgtaaatccaatctaaatttaatcttcaactaaatcatgaaaagcctc antisense . the s.pombe cdna library used as a template in the amplification was kindly provided by r.rowley university of utah . the c.elegans antizyme gene was amplified using the following primers 5 -cccaggaattcctcgagtattttga gtataattttac sense and 5 -cggccgctcgagttagacctt gtagctcatgatg antisense . this same amplified dna was used to make the constructs for in vitro transcription and translation of c.elegans antizyme by cloning it into ptz18u plasmid using the saci and hindiii sites incorporated in the two primers. the in-frame construct was made using a two-step pcr. the cdna sequences of o.volvulus and p.pacificus antizyme genes were obtained by performing 5 and 3 race pcr with cdna libraries which were kindly provided by ralf sommer p.pacificus and susan haynes o.volvulus . the spa overexpression constructs were made by amplifying the gene with the primers 5 -gcatccgaattcccaaatccaagcatcatacgcc sense and 5 -gcatccggatccgccagtgttcttactttgaga tgc antisense and then inserting bamhi-digested product between the msci and bamhi sites of prep3 plasmid. the in-frame construct was made by two-step pcr and subsequently all in-frame spa constructs described below were made by one-step pcr using this plasmid s dna as a template. to make the constructs for frameshift assays in s.pombe dna fragments with a given nucleotide length as described in the main text were amplified from both the spa and c.elegans antizyme constructs described above. these fragments were then cloned between the kpni and bsteii sites of piu-lac plasmid ivanov et al. 1998c . the pcr primers included an ac spacer between the 5 cloning site bsteii and the antizyme sequences in order to correct the reading frame. the in vivo frameshifting assays in s.pombe strains ura4-d18 leu1-32 ade6-m216 h and δspa leu2 ura4-d18 leu1-32 ade6-m216 h were done as described ivanov et al. 1998c . the plasmid for gst spa expression was made by pcr amplifying spa all but the first codon of orf1 through the downstream orf2 from an in-frame template and cloning the product into the ecori and xhoi restriction sites of pgex-5x-3 plasmid. the antizyme frameshift site in the bmv-coat-antizyme fusion construct c3ne matsufuji et al. 1995 was mutated with a two-step pcr. to generate the two knockout strains δspa ura4 and δspa leu2 both orfs of spa were replaced exactly with the orf of either ura4 or leu2. to accomplish this two pairs of primers amplified ura4 and leu2 such that 50 60 nucleotides which normally flank the two orfs of spa flank the orfs of the two genes. the amplified dna products were gel purified and 2 µg of each were used to electroporate into ura4-d18 leu1-32 ade6-m216 h cells. ura and leu transformants were selected by growth on ura and leu media respectively. pcr screen and partial sequencing with primers flanking the regions used for the homologous recombination confirmed the spa disruptions. all dna clones were sequenced with automated sequencing machines abi 100 . schizosaccharomyces pombe odc active crude extracts were prepared as follows s.pombe strain 1519 leu1-32 h provided by r.rowley was grown to od600 0.7 in 50 ml of minimal media leu. ten milligrams of lysing enzymes sigma were added followed by continued incubation for 30 min at 30 c. cells were harvested and washed once with cold homogenization buffer 25 mm tris hcl ph 7 0.25 m sucrose 1 mm dithiothreitol dtt 20 µm pyridoxal-5-phosphate 2 mm edta then resuspended in 0.75 ml of homogenization buffer. cells were broken open and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10 000 r.p.m. for 15 min at 4 c. extracts were dialyzed overnight in dialysis buffer 25 mm tris hcl ph 7.4 1 mm dtt 20 µm pyridoxal-5-phosphate 0.1 mm edta . a volume of 25 µl of extract was used for each odc assay. odc activity was assayed by measuring the release of 14co2 from l- 1-14c ornithine amersham as described nishiyama et al. 1988 . each reaction took 1 h. pre-incubation of s.pombe extract with 0.1 mm difluoromethyl ornithine dfmo for 15 min led to 99 inhibition of 14co2 release. the cells were collected by centrifugation washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline pbs and then the pellet was frozen at 80 c until use. the pellet was resuspended in 0.1 ml of pbs. an aliquot of the suspension was mixed with an equal volume of 8 perchloric acid vortexed for 1 min kept on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 15 000 r.p.m. 4 c for 5 min. ten microliters of the supernatant were subjected to polyamine analysis using fluorometry on high-performance liquid chromatography as described previously murakami et al. 1989 . protein concentrations were determined with the bca protein assay kit pierce . the experiments with the bmv-coat-antizyme fusion constructs were performed as described previously matsufuji et al. 1995 . all other plasmid dna templates were prepared using qiagen miniprep kit and then digested with hindiii. transcripts for spa in vitro translation were made from pcr templates that had a t7 promoter incorporated into the pcr primers. linearized dna 1 µg was used as a template for in vitro transcription with ambion megashortscripttm t7 kit. the dnase-treated rnas were recovered and resuspended in 40 µl of rnase-free water. one microliter of each specified transcript suspension was used in each in vitro translation reaction 0.5 µl of 1 mm amino acid mix met 7 µl of reticulocyte lysate promega 0.5 µl of 35s met amersham to a total volume of 10 µl. the reactions were stopped by adding 1 µl of rnase 10 mg ml . the frameshift efficiencies were quantified as described ivanov et al. 1998a .'}}\n"
